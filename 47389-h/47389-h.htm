<p>No one can have glanced at <em>Our
Village</em>, or any of the charming
sketches of Miss Mitford, without
having been struck by the peculiar
elegance, the raciness, the simplicity
of her style. It is as free in all its
movements as that pet of hers, the
Italian greyhound she has made so
familiar to us all&mdash;as free and as
graceful. A beautiful style is no
singularity in our days, and there are
many orders of such beauty; nevertheless,
Miss Mitford has a dialect
of her own. It is a style gathered
from familiarity with the classic, and
especially the dramatic poets, and
with whatever is most terse and elegant
amongst our prose writers, and
yet applied with perfect ease to the
simplest details of life, to the real
transaction and the daily scene before
her. You would think every one
was talking in the same manner; it
is only Miss Mitford who speaks this
dialect. It is as if any one should
learn Italian from the works of Petrarch
or Tasso, or any other of their
classics, and be able to apply the
language he had thus acquired without
the least restraint to the common
purposes of life; every Italian would
understand him, and seem to speak
like him, and yet he would remain in
exclusive possession of his own Tuscan
speech.</p>

<p>Miss Mitford is one of those who
have made the discovery that there is
always a "California" under our feet,
if we look for it. She detected, by her
own independent sagacity, and before
the truth was so generally known and
so generally acted upon as it is at
present, that what most interests in
books is precisely that which is nearest
to us in real life. She did not
find it necessary to go to the Alps or
the Pyrenees for her landscape, nor
to Spain or Constantinople for her
men and women; she looked down
the lane that led from her own cottage-door;
she saw the children in it,
and the loaded hay-cart; she saw
Arabia with all her tents in that
gipsy encampment where the same
kettle seems to swing for ever between
the same three poles&mdash;nomadic
race, eternally wandering and never
progressing. She looked out of her
own window, and within it her own
home&mdash;always cheerful, or always deserving
to be such, from the cheerful
spirit of its owner; and she found in
all these things, near and dear to her,
sufficient subjects for her pencil. And
very faithfully she paints the village
scene&mdash;with, at least, as much fidelity
to truth as a graceful womanly spirit
could summon up resolution enough to
practise. A light something too golden
falls uniformly over the picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>A work professing to be the <cite>Recollections
of a Literary Life</cite>, and that
literary life Miss Mitford's, could not
fail to attract us. The subject is one of
the most interesting an author could
select; for, in addition to whatever
charm it may acquire from personal
narrative, the recollections in which
it deals are in themselves thoughts, in
themselves literature. They must
always have this twofold interest&mdash;whatever
they gain from the reminiscent,
and whatever they possess themselves
of sterling value. The subject
is excellent, and we are persuaded
that Miss Mitford is capable of doing
ample justice to it; all we have to
regret here is that she has not thrown
herself completely and unreservedly
into her subject; she never seems,
indeed, quite to have determined what
should be the distinct scope and purpose
of her work. This apparent indecision
or hesitation on her part is,
we suspect, the sole cause of any disappointment
which some of its readers
may possibly feel.</p>

<p>Our authoress has been unwilling
to launch herself on the full stream
or current of her own personal reminiscences
and feelings, to write what
would be, in fact, little else than an
autobiography; she has shrunk back,
afraid of the charge of being too personal,
too egotistical. A delicacy and
sensitiveness very natural; and yet
the very nature of her subject required
that she should brave this charge. It
was not a mere selection of extracts
and quotations, accompanied by a few
critical remarks, which she intended
to give us. If this had been her sole,
original, and specific purpose, we venture
to say that it would have been,
in many respects, a very different
series of extracts she would have
brought together. Now, if Miss Mitford
had boldly recalled her own intellectual
history&mdash;giving us the favourite
passages of her favourite authors,
as they were still living in her
memory and affections, (for of that
which has <em>ceased</em> to be admired the
faintest glance is sufficient)&mdash;she
would have produced a far superior
work to that which lies before us.
Or if, discarding altogether her own
personal history, she had merely gone
into her library, and, pulling down
from the shelves a certain number of
favourite authors, had selected from
each what she most approved, accompanying
her quotations with some
critical and biographical notices, and
arranging them in something like harmonious
order, so that we should not
be tossed too abruptly from one author
to another of quite different age
and character, she could not have
failed, here also, of producing a work
complete of its kind. In the first
case, we should have had the unity
and the interest of a continuous and
personal narrative; in the second
case, we should have had a higher
order of selections and criticisms; the
beauty of the quotation would have
been the sole motive for inserting it;
and her clear critical faculty would
have been unbiassed by the amiable
partialities of friendship.</p>

<p>As we cannot tell, however, with
what anticipations the reader may
open a book of this description,
(which, in its premises, must be always
more or less vague,) we are
perhaps altogether wrong in supposing
that he is likely to feel any disappointment
whatever. There is
much in it which cannot fall to interest
him. But if he does experience
to any degree this feeling of disappointment,
it will be traceable to
the simple fact we have been pointing
out&mdash;the want of a settled plan or
purpose in the work itself. No one
knows better than Miss Mitford that,
if a writer is not quite determined in
the scope and object of his own book,
he is pretty sure to leave a certain
indistinct and unsatisfactory impression
on his reader.</p>

<p>Having said thus much in the absence
of a definite purpose, we ought
to permit the authoress to explain
herself upon this head. "The title
of this book," she says in the preface,
"gives a very imperfect idea of the
contents. Perhaps it would be difficult
to find a short phrase that would
accurately describe a work so miscellaneous
and so wayward; a work
where there is far too much of personal
gossip and of local scene-painting
for the grave pretension of critical
essays, and far too much of criticism
and extract for anything approaching
in the slightest degree to autobiography.
The courteous reader must
take it for what it is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>We hope to rank amongst "courteous
readers," and will "take it for
what it is." <cite>Recollections of a Literary
Life</cite> was a title which promised
too much; but there was no help for
it: a title the book must have, and
we can easily understand that, under
certain circumstances, the choice of a
name may be a very difficult matter.
Whatever name may best become it,
the book is, without doubt, full of
pleasant and agreeable reading. A
better companion for the summer's
afternoon we could not recommend.
That "personal gossip" of which the
preface speaks, is written in the most
charming manner imaginable; and it
will be impossible, we think, for any
one, however familiar with our literature,
not to meet, amongst the quotations,
with some which he will sincerely
thank the authoress for having
brought before him.</p>

<p>Having thus discharged our critical
conscience by insisting, perhaps with
a more severe impartiality than the
case demanded, on the one apparent
defect in the very structure and design
of this book, we have now only to
retrace our steps through it, pausing
where the matter prompts an observation,
or where it affords an apt
example of the kind of interest which
pervades it. And first we must
revert to that "personal gossip," to
which we have a decided predilection,
and in which Miss Mitford pre-eminently
excels: in her hands it becomes
an art. Here is something
about "Woodcock Lane." She is
about to introduce her old favourites,
Beaumont and Fletcher, and
carries us first to a certain pleasant
retreat where she was accustomed to
read these dramatists. "I pore over
them," she says, "in the silence and
solitude of a certain green lane, about
half a mile from home; sometimes
seated on the roots of an old fantastic
beech, sometimes on the trunk of a
felled oak, or sometimes on the ground
itself, with my back propped lazily
against a rugged elm."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In that very lane," she continues,
"am I writing on this sultry June day,
luxuriating in the shade&mdash;the verdure,
the fragrance of hay-field and bean-field,
and the absence of all noise, except the
song of birds, and that strange mingling
of many sounds, the whir of a thousand
forms of insect life, so often heard among
the general hush of a summer noon....</p>

<p>"Occasional passengers there are, however,
gentle and simple. My friend, Mr
B., for instance, has just cantered past
on his blood-horse, with a nod and a
smile, saying nothing, but apparently a
good deal amused with my arrangements.
And here comes a procession of cows
going to milking, with an old attendant,
still called the cow-boy, who, although
they have seen me often enough, one
should think, sitting underneath a tree
writing, with my little maid close by
hemming flounces, and my dog, Fanchon,
nestled at my feet&mdash;still <em>will</em> start as if
they had never seen a woman before in
their lives. Back they start, and then
they rush forward, and then the old
drover emits certain sounds, which it is
to be presumed the cows understand;
sounds so horribly discordant that little
Fanchon&mdash;although to her too they ought
to be familiar, if not comprehensible&mdash;starts
up in a fright on her feet, deranging
all the economy of my extempore
desk, and wellnigh upsetting the inkstand.
Very much frightened is my
pretty pet, the arrantest coward that
ever walked upon four legs! And so
she avenges herself, as cowards are wont
to do, by following the cows at safe distance,
as soon as they are fairly past,
and beginning to bark amain when they
axe nearly out of sight. Then follows a
motley group of the same nature&mdash;colts,
yearlings, calves, heifers, with a shouting
boy, and his poor shabby mongrel cur, for
driver. The poor cur wants to play with
Fanchon, but Fanchon, besides being a
coward, is also a beauty, and holds her
state; although I think, if he could but
stay long enough, that the good-humour
of the poor merry creature would prove
infectious, and beguile the little lady into
a game of romps. Lastly appears the
most solemn troop of all, a grave company
of geese and goslings, with the
gander at their head, marching with the
decorum and dignity proper to the birds
who saved Rome. Fanchon, who once
had an affair with a gander, in which she
was notably worsted, retreats out of sight,
and ensconces herself between me and
the tree.</p>

<p>"Such are our passers-by. Sometimes
we have what I was about to call settled
inhabitants, in the shape of a camp of
gipsies."</p></blockquote>

<p>After describing this camp of gipsies,
and how the men carry on a sort
of "trade in forest ponies," and how
the women make and sell baskets "at
about double the price at which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
might be bought at the dearest shop
in the good town of Belford Regis,"
she proceeds to tell us how, notwithstanding
her perfect knowledge of
this fact, she is induced to become a
purchaser.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Last Saturday I happened to be
sitting on a fallen tree somewhat weary,
my little damsel working as usual at the
other end, and Fanchon balancing himself
on the trunk between us; the curls of
her brown coat&mdash;she is entirely brown&mdash;turning
into gold as the sunshine played
upon them through the leaves.</p>

<p>"In this manner were we disposed,
when a gipsy, with a pair of light baskets
in her hand, came and offered them
for sale. She was a middle-aged woman,
who, in spite of her wandering life&mdash;perhaps
because of that hardy out-of-door
life&mdash;had retained much of her early
beauty: the flashing eyes, the pearly
teeth, the ruddy cheeks, the fine erect
figure. It happened that, not wanting
them, my companion had rejected these
identical baskets when brought to our
door in the morning. She told me so,
and I quietly declined them. My friend
the gipsy apparently gave the matter up,
and, claiming me as an old acquaintance,
began to inquire after my health, and
fell into the pleasantest strain of conversation
possible; spoke of my father, who,
she said, had been kind to her and to her
tribe, (no doubt she said truly; he was
kind to everybody, and had a liking for
the wandering race,) spoke of her children
at the gipsy school in Dorsetshire; of the
excellent Mr Crabbe, the friend of her
people, at Southampton; then she began
stroking Fanchon, (who actually, to my
astonishment, permitted the liberty; in
general she suffers no one to touch her
that is not gentleman or lady;) Fanchon
she stroked, and of Flush, the dear old
dog, now lying buried under the rose-tree,
she talked; then, to leave no one
unpropitiated, she threw out a word of
pleasant augury, a sort of gratuitous fortune-telling,
to the hemmer of flounces;
then she attacked me again with old
recollections, trusting, with singular
knowledge of human nature, to the power
of the future upon the young, and of the
past upon the old&mdash;to me she spoke of
happy memories, to my companion of
happiness to come; and so&mdash;how could
I help it?&mdash;I bought the baskets."</p></blockquote>

<p>After this little excursion into
Woodcock Lane, we are introduced
to Messrs Beaumont and Fletcher.
The quotations from these authors
we should have no object in reproducing
here. One thing we cannot
help noticing. Both on this and on
some other occasions we are struck
by an omission, by a silence. Though
she may think fit to represent these
dramatists as her favourite companions,
we are morally certain that
it was a far greater than either of
them who was generally her delight
and her study in that shady solitude.
Could we have looked over the page
as she sate there leaning so amiably
against that "rugged elm," we are
sure that it would have been Shakspeare
that we should have found in
her hands. But why no word of
Shakspeare? We think we can conjecture
the cause of this omission;
and, if our surmise is correct, we
quite sympathise with the feeling that
led to it. Miss Mitford is a sincere
and ardent admirer of Shakspeare;
she must be so&mdash;in common with
every intelligent person who reads
poetry at all. But Miss Mitford likes
to keep her senses; has a shrewd,
quiet intelligence; has little love for
what is vague or violent in criticism
any more than in poetry; and she has
felt that the extravagant, rhodomontade
style of panegyric now prevalent
upon our greatest of poets, reduced
her to silence. She could not out-Herod
Herod; she could not outbid
these violent declaimers who speak of
Shakspeare as if he were a god, who
admire all they read which bears his
name&mdash;the helter-skelter entangled
confusion and obscurity, the wretched
conceit, the occasional bombast&mdash;admire
all, and thereby prove they have
no right to any admiration whatever.
She was, therefore, like many others
who love and reverence him most,
reduced to silence. Some years hence
a sensible word may be written of
Shakspeare. At present, he who
would praise with discrimination must
apparently place himself in the rank
of his detractors.</p>

<p>Miss Mitford's critical taste leads
her to an especial preference of what
is distinct and intelligible in all the
departments of literature. To some
it may appear that she is more capable
of doing justice to poetry of the
secondary than of the higher and
more spiritual order. However that
may be, we, for our own part, congratulated
ourselves on an escape from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
that vague and mystical criticism
which is so prevalent in our day.
There are two words which a certain
class of writers never pronounce without
going off into frenzy or delirious
raving. "Shakspeare" is one of
these words; the "Infinite" is the
other. They have made the discovery
that this poet or that painter talks
or paints the "infinite." They find
in every obscurity of thought, in every
violence of passion, the "infinite."
There is no such thing as "sound and
fury signifying nothing." They always
signify the "infinite." If there is the
"infinite" in criticism, they certainly
have reached it. In Goldsmith's time,
it was "Shakspeare and the musical
glasses;" it is now "Shakspeare and
the Infinite." We suspect that the
musical glasses were more amusing,
and are sure that they had quite as
much meaning.</p>

<p>We go back to Woodcock Lane. We
rather cruelly abridged our last extract,
on purpose that we might have
space for one other of the same description.
We make no apology for
clinging to this "personal gossip."
Very few of the poetical quotations
throughout the work have more of
beauty and of pathos than the concluding
paragraph of the next extract
we shall give. <em>Apropos</em> of Sir Philip
Sydney's <cite>Arcadia</cite>, she makes us participators
in her country rambles;
and <em>apropos</em> of these she introduces
us to an old friend, a walking-stick&mdash;"pretty
nearly as well known as ourselves
in our Berkshire village." Some
sixty years ago it was "a stick of
quality," having belonged to a certain
Duchess-Dowager of Atholl; but the
circumstance that her own mother had
taken to using it, during her latter
days, had especially endeared it to her.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And then," as she observes with finest
tact, "everybody knows how the merest
trifles which have formed part of the daily
life of the loved and lost, especially those
things which they have touched, are cherished,
and cared for, and put aside; how
we dare not look upon them for very love;
and how, by some accident that nobody
can explain, they come to light in the
course of time, and after a momentary
increase of sadness, help to familiarise
and render pleasant the memory by which
they are endeared."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is very beautifully expressed,
and it is the tone of right sentiment;
truthful, natural, the unaffected sadness
that tempers into a sweet and
pleasant memory.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"So the stick," she continues, "reappeared
in the hall, and, from some whim
which I have never rightly understood
myself, I, who had no more need of such
a supporter than the youngest woman in
the parish&mdash;who was, indeed, the best
walker of my years for a dozen miles
round, and piqued myself not a little upon
so being&mdash;took a fancy to use this stick
in my own proper person, and most pertinaciously
carried this fancy into execution.
Much was I laughed at for this
crotchet, and I laughed too. Friends
questioned, strangers stared; but, impassive
to stare or to question, I remained
constant to my supporter. Except when
I went to London, (for I paid so much
homage to public opinion as to avoid such
a display <em>there</em>,) I should as soon have
thought of walking out without my bonnet
as without my stick. That stick was my
inseparable companion."</p></blockquote>

<p>The staff had met with its share of
misadventures and accidents; "one
misfortune, so to say personal, which
befel it, was the loss of its own head;"
but its loss from the pony-chaise, its
fall from the chaise into a brook which
had been passed through the day
before, is the especial calamity here
celebrated. By this time we learn
with regret that the stick has become
more than a whim&mdash;has grown into a
useful and necessary friend:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I might have observed that something
was amiss in our small household; that
Sarah answered the bell, and that the
hemmer of flounces, when she did appear,
seemed flurried and fatigued. But I was
thinking of Sir Philip Sydney, of the
<cite>Defence of Poetry</cite>, of the <cite>Arcadia</cite>, and of
my own resolution to proceed to the
green lane, and to dissect that famous
pastoral, and select from the mass, which
even to myself I hardly confessed to be
ponderous, such pages as might suit an
age that by no means partakes of my taste
for folios. So I said to her, 'That the
afternoon being cool, and I less lame than
usual, I thought we should not need Sam
and the pony-chaise, but that I could
manage by the help of my stick.'</p>

<p>"At that word out burst the terrible
tidings. My stick, my poor old stick,
my life-long friend, the faithful companion
of so many walks, was missing,
was gone, was lost! Last night, on our
return from the lane, the place in the
pony-chaise where Sam and I had carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
deposited it was found vacant.
Already hue and cry had everywhere
been made. 'And really, ma'am,' quoth
she, 'there is some comfort in the interest
people take in the stick. If it were anything
alive, the pony or Fanchon, or little
Henry, or we ourselves, they could not
be more sorry. Master Brent, ma'am, at
the top of the street, he promises to speak
to everybody; so does William Wheeler,
who goes everywhere; and Mrs Bromley
at the shop; and the carrier; and the
postman. I dare say the whole parish
knows it by this time! I have not been
outside the gate to-day, but a dozen
people have asked me if we had heard of
<em>our</em> stick. It must turn up soon. If one
had but the slightest notion where it was
lost!'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Well! we at last sate down on our
old turf seats, not far from the entrance
of a field, where an accident (in the
wheat-carrying, which was then in full
activity) had evidently taken place; a
loaded waggon must have knocked against
the gate, and spilt some of its topmost
sheaves. The sheaves were taken away,
but the place was strewed with relics of
the upset, and a little harvest of the long
yellow straw and the rich brown ears
remained to tempt the gleaners. As we
were talking over this misfortune, and
our own, and I was detailing my reasons
for believing that my poor stick had
found a watery grave, we became aware
of two little girls, who stole timidly and
quietly up to the place, and began gladly
and thankfully to pick up the scattered
corn.</p>

<p>"Poor little things, we knew them
well! We had known their father died
of consumption scarcely a month ago;
and affecting it was to see these poor
children, delicate girls of seven and five
years old, already at work to help their
widowed mother, and rejoicing over the
discovery of these few ears of fallen
wheat, as if it were the gold mines of
California. A drove of pigs was looming
in the distance; and my little damsel
flung down her work, and sprang up at
once to help the poor children. She has
a taste for helping people, has my little
maid, and puts her whole heart and soul
into such kindnesses. It was worth
something to see how she pounced upon
every straggling straw, clearing away all
round the outside, and leaving the space
within for the little girls. The ground
was cleared before the drove came near.</p>

<p>"Pleasant it was to see her zealous
activity, and the joy and surprise of the
little creatures, who, weak, timid, and
lonely, had till then only collected about
a dozen ears, when they found themselves
loaded with more than they could carry.
Their faded frocks were by her contrivance
pinned up about them, filled with
the golden wheat-ears, and the children
went home happy.... Many a
rich mother might be proud of the two
gleaners that we have seen this afternoon.
They so pleased and so thankful to carry
their poor store to that poor home; they
carried thither better things than wheat."</p></blockquote>

<p>But for the fate of the stick, and
how it was found, and what was
done that day with Sir Philip Sydney's
<cite>Arcadia</cite>, we must refer the reader
to the book itself. We must now
proceed to take some general survey
of the far larger portion of the work,
which consists of extracts, with some
biographical and critical notices.</p>

<p>The series of quotations does not
open very auspiciously: we are presented
with some Irish ballads of
Mr Thomas Davis, which we do not
think will excite in many readers
the same amount of admiration they
appear to have done in Miss Mitford.
We must prefer the song she has
given, as by Mr Banim, the author
of the <cite>Tales of the O'Hara Family</cite>.
It is simple and graceful:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>There is a brief notice of another
writer, a countryman of Mr Banim's,
which is very touching. Gerald
Griffin seems to have sounded every
note of that gay and sad and mournful
destiny which the young poet
has to endure, who, with a proud,
aspiring, sensitive nature, fronts the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
terrible commonplace of human life&mdash;who
out of dreams and imagery and
sentiment has to coin the means
of subsistence. We see him starting
from some place near Limerick, with
his pocket full of plays. Alas! we
see him labouring in London, almost
friendless and alone, at mere literary
toils, some hopeless love added to his
other despondencies, till, broken down
in health and courage, and despairing
of success, he quits the field, and
"joins the Society of Christian
Brethren at Cork." No need to
go back to the middle ages for
romance, if the romance of life
consists in suffering and the alternation
of hope and despondency, or
of hopes transplanted from this world
to the next. The soldier and the
monastery; the dramatic poet and
the "Christian Brethren at Cork"&mdash;there
is the same tale in both.</p>

<p>We have another contemporary
instance brought before us, where the
poetic fervour or ambition led to a
far sadder retreat than this Society,
whatever it may be, of Christian
Brethren. John Clare, while following
the plough, had looked on nature
with the eye of a poet. Pity that
he could not have written his poetry,
and still clung to his plough. But
he left the fields for life in cities,
and, instead of singing for the song's
sake, commenced singing for the
support of wife and family. Hence
came madness&mdash;in this instance, that
actual insanity which the physician
can catalogue and describe.</p>

<p>It is worth noticing that his first
patron, Lord Exeter, had really entertained
the design of so assisting the
rustic poet that he should be able to
unite his favourite pursuit with his
early, healthy, invigorating occupations
of husbandry. Surely there is
nothing incompatible between them.
"Lord Exeter," we are told, "sent
for him to Burleigh, and hearing that
he earned thirty pounds per annum
by field-labour, settled an annuity of
fifteen pounds upon him, with a view
to his devoting half his time to agricultural
pursuits, and half to literary
pursuits." We like this idea of his
noble patron; it bespeaks, we think,
a very reflective as well as a generous
mind. But there were patrons of a
very different stamp, or rather, according
to the account we have here,
a number of officious, vulgar admirers
of poor John Clare, who rendered the
design abortive; who had nothing to
offer to the village poet, but who disturbed
his quiet, intelligent, safe,
unostentatious, and healthy existence,
by their absurd and idle curiosity.
He was called away from his fields&mdash;to
be looked at! "He was frequently
interrupted, as often as three times
a-day, during his labours in the harvest-field,
to gratify the curiosity of
admiring visitors." We cannot blame
poor John Clare for leaving his labours
in the harvest-field; it has
always been the weakness of the poet
to love praise too much; without this
weakness he would hardly have been
a poet, at least he would have been a
very careless one; but we think those
"admiring visitors" showed their
taste and their love of poetry in a
most extraordinary manner. Whatever
else they felt, they felt no respect
for the dignity of the man.
They ought to have understood that
visits of such a kind, for such an idle
purpose, whatever flattering shape
they may have assumed, were insults.</p>

<p>Miss Mitford terminates the painful
history by the following singular
account:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A few years ago he was visited by a
friend of mine, who gave me a most interesting
account of the then state of his
intellect. His delusions were at that
time very singular in their character:
whatever he read, whatever recurred to
him from his former reading, or happened
to be mentioned in conversation, became
impressed on his mind as a thing that he
had witnessed and acted in. My friend was
struck with a narrative of the execution
of Charles the Fist, recounted by Clare
as a transaction that had occurred yesterday,
and of which he was an eye-witness&mdash;a
narrative the most graphic and
minute, with an accuracy as to costume
and manners far exceeding what would
probably have been at his command if
sane. It is such a lucidity as the disciples
of Mesmer claim for clairvoyance.
Or he would relate the battle of the
Nile and the death of Lord Nelson with
the same perfect keeping, especially as to
seamanship, fancying himself one of the
sailors who had been in the action, and
dealing out nautical phrases with admirable
exactness and accuracy, although
it is doubtful if he ever saw the sea in
his life."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>As might have been expected, and
is both graceful and natural, the poets
of her own sex occupy a considerable
space in Miss Mitford's selections.
In some cases the names were new to
us, but the extracts given made us
feel that they ought not to have been
so. An Englishman may be very
proud, we think, when he reflects how
many highly cultivated minds there
are amongst his countrywomen, minds
so gentle and so intelligent, whose
cultivation goes hand in hand with the
truest refinement of character. Here
in one chapter we have four names
strung together, most of which, we
suspect, will be new to the majority
of readers&mdash;"Mrs Clive, Mrs Acton
Tindal, Miss Day, Mrs Robert Dering"&mdash;yet
the extracts in this chapter
will bear comparison with those of
any other part of the work. A little
poem called "The Infant Bridal," is,
as Miss Mitford describes it to be,
one of the most perfect paintings we
ever <em>read</em>. Its subject is the marriage
of Richard Duke of York, second
son of Edward IV., with Anne
Mowbray, Duchess of Norfolk. The
bridegroom was not five years old,
and the bride scarcely three. The
procession, where, at the head of
"belted barons" and courtly dames,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Two blooming children led the way<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With short and doubtful tread;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">the ceremony, where the venerable
prelate gives his blessing to this
infant bride and bridegroom, and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Their steady gaze these children meek<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon the old man bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As earnestly they seemed to seek<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The solemn words intent."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Every part of the narrative is so
charmingly told that we cannot consent
to mar the effect by any broken
quotation. It is too long to be extracted
entirely.</p>

<p>From the poem which follows, of
Miss Day's, it will be easier to break
off a fragment.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have now to introduce," says Miss
Mitford, "another fair artist into the
female gallery of which I am so proud;
an artist whose works seem to me to
bear the same relation to sculpture that
those of Mrs Acton Tindal do to painting.
The poetry of Miss Day is statuesque
in its dignity, in its purity, in its repose.
Purity is perhaps the distinguishing
quality of this fine writer, pervading the
conception, the thoughts, and the diction.
But she must speak for herself. As
'The Infant Bridal' might form a sketch
for an historical picture, so 'Charlotte
Corday' is a model, standing ready to be
chiselled in Parian stone."</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Stately and beautiful and chaste,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Forth went the dauntless maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her blood to yield, her youth to waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That carnage might be stayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This solemn purpose filled her soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There was no room for fear;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She made her gleaming weapon dart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And stained her soul with blood."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In another chapter of her work
Miss Mitford gives us a slight biographical
sketch of one who needs no
introduction here or elsewhere&mdash;of the
now celebrated Mrs Browning. The
sketch is very interesting, but the
extract given from her poems is not
very happily selected. Miss Mitford
does not seem to have ventured to
trust herself among the more daring
beauties&mdash;the bolder and more spiritual
flights of her friend Mrs Browning.
Her taste clings, as we have
said, to what is distinct and definite.
Of this we have rather an amusing
instance in the criticism she passes
on Shelley's <cite>Alastor</cite>. There is good
sense and some truth in the criticism,
and yet it is not all that ought to
have been said of such a poem:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The first time," she says, "I ever
met with any of his works, this vagueness
brought me into a ludicrous dilemma.
It was in the great library of Tavistock
House that Mr Perry one morning put
into my hand a splendidly printed and
splendidly bound volume, (<cite>Alastor</cite>, as I
think,) and desired me to read it, and
give him my opinion. 'You will at least
know,' he said, 'whether it be worth anybody
else's reading.'</p>

<p>"Accordingly I took up the magnificent
presentation copy, and read conscientiously
till visitors came in. I had no
marker, and the richly-bound volume
closed as if instinctively; so that when I
resumed my task, on the departure of
the company, not being able to find my
place, I was obliged to begin the book at
the first line. More visitors came and
went, and still the same calamity befell
me; again, and again, and again I had to
search in vain amongst a succession of
melodious lines, as like each other as the
waves of the sea, for buoy or landmark, and
had always to put back to shore and begin
my voyage anew. I do not remember
having been ever in my life more ashamed
of my own stupidity, than when obliged
to say to Mr Perry, in answer to his
questions as to the result of my morning's
studies, that doubtless it was a very fine
poem&mdash;only, that I never could tell, when
I took up the book, where I had left off
half an hour before&mdash;an unintended
criticism, which, as characteristic both of
author and reader, very much amused
my kind and clever host."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, if, instead of the magnificent
presentation copy, read in the great
library of Tavistock House, where
visitors were coming in and going
out, Miss Mitford had taken a little
homely manageable volume down
Woodcock Lane, and there read
<cite>Alastor</cite>, undisturbed, beneath the
shadow of the trees, she must, we
think, have had to record a very different
impression of the poem. She
would have needed no "marker."
Perhaps there would have lived in
her memory an hour of intellectual
pleasure as great as any that the page
of the poet had ever procured for her.
Though not the highest effort of Shelley's
genius, <cite>Alastor</cite> is probably the
most pleasing. There is no tortuosity
of thought to pardon or to forget; it
is one unbroken interwoven strain of
music, of imagery, of sentiment.
Those who have defined poetry as
the luxury of thought, could nowhere
find a better example to illustrate
their meaning&mdash;it is all music, imagination,
feeling. Oh, when the summer
months come round, let us entreat
Miss Mitford <em>to try it in Woodcock
Lane</em>! How could she trust to anything
she had read out of a magnificent
presentation copy, in the great
library at Tavistock House?</p>

<p>The quotation from Keats is very
skilfully selected; it must please the
most fastidious taste, and is yet sufficiently
peculiar to suggest that no
one but Keats could have written it.
From the writings of W. S. Landor
she might have gathered much better,
and without devoting to them any
larger space than she has done. If
she had turned to the miscellaneous
poems which conclude his collected
works, she might have extracted two
or three of the most polished and
perfect lyrics in our language, and
which have the precise qualification,
in this case so indispensable, of being
very brief.</p>

<p>Mr Landor, by the way, will be
much amused to find himself praised&mdash;for
what will our readers think?&mdash;for
modesty! "I prefer," says Miss
Mitford, "to select from the Hellenics,
that charming volume, because very
few have given such present life to
classical subjects. <em>I begin with the
preface, so full of grace and modesty.</em>"</p>

<p>In the lady's mind, grace and
modesty are no doubt inseparable
companions; and, finding abundance
of the one in Mr Landor's style, she
concluded that the other must be
there also. Of <em>that other</em> there is not
an atom in all his writings, and there
never was intended to be. It is a
maidenly quality which he never had
the remotest design of laying claim
to. The very preface which she
quotes is a piece of undisguised sarcasm.
We doubt if there is much
grace in it, certainly there is no
modesty. Here is the commencement
of this modest preface. "It is hardly
to be expected that ladies and gentlemen
will leave on a sudden their daily
promenade, skirted by Turks, and
shepherds, and knights, and plumes,
and palfreys <em>of the finest Tunbridge
manufacture</em>, to look at these rude
frescoes, delineated on an old wall,
high up, and sadly weak in colouring.
<em>As in duty bound, we can wait.</em>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>If Miss Mitford should ever read
this preface again, she will pass her
hand over her brow, a little puzzled
where it was she saw the "modesty."
She will appeal to Fanchon, who will
be sitting in her lap, looking very
intently over the page, and ask him
what he thinks of the matter. Fanchon
will laugh out obstreperously, will
bark delighted, at the amiable blunder
of his mistress.</p>

<p>We remarked that we had been
occasionally struck with an omission,
or a silence. It seems to us a characteristic
circumstance that we hear
no mention made of Lord Byron.
Wordsworth and Southey, Coleridge
and Shelley, get some space allotted to
them, larger or smaller; but he who
occupied so conspicuous a position
among these very contemporaries has
none whatever. It is not because he
still holds a very high rank amongst
our poets&mdash;though by no means the
same eminence that was once assigned
to him&mdash;that we notice this omission;
but because his writings had so strong
and peculiar an influence on most
minds open to the influence of poetry,
that we naturally expect to meet with
his name in the literary recollections
of one who, we way venture to say
without any ungallant reference to
chronology, must have lived in that
period when Lord Byron was in the
ascendant. There are few persons
who, in acknowledging the happy
influence of Wordsworth's poetry,
would not have to commence their
confession by some account of the very
opposite influence of Lord Byron's.
We should have said that the Byronic
fever was a malady which hardly any
of our contemporaries, who are liable
to catch a fever of any kind from
books, had entirely escaped. Miss
Mitford, however, hints at no such
calamity. Her excellent constitution
seems to have preserved her from it.
She bore a charm against all such
plagues, in her clear sense and cheerful
temper. She was thereby preserved
from some very absurd misery&mdash;very
absurd, but most indisputable
misery; and she also lost some experience
of a not unprofitable nature&mdash;certain
lessons of wisdom which,
being <em>burnt into one</em>, are never afterwards
to be obliterated from the
mind.</p>

<p>If the subject were but one shade
more attractive, or less repulsive than
it is, we would, for the benefit of such
exempted persons as Miss Mitford,
describe the course and the symptoms
of this Byronic fever. We would
describe how, some luckless day, the
youth who ought to be busy with his
Greek or his Euclid plays truant over
the poetry of <cite>Childe Harold</cite> and
<cite>Manfred</cite>; how it makes him brimful
of unaccountable misery; how, as is
most natural, he reads on the faster&mdash;reads
on insatiate and insensate.</p>

<p>But what tossings and throbbings
and anguish the patient endures we
have no wish to depict. The one thing
worth noticing is this, that although
the sufferer is perfectly convinced
that the whole world is, or ought to
be, as wretched as himself, he has not,
in all his compositions, one jot of
compassion left&mdash;not one jot for any
species of misery, not even that which
resembles and re-echoes his own.
Some calamities are said to teach us
sympathy with the calamities of
others&mdash;so sings Virgil, we remember&mdash;but
this misery has the property of
hardening the heart against any
human sympathy whatever. One of
these imaginary misanthropes cannot
even tolerate the lamentations of
another. You may listen to his outcries
and denunciations if you will,
but if, in your turn, you wish to bellow
ever so little, you must go into
the next field&mdash;go many fields off.
Very curious is the hardness of heart
bred out of a morbid passion of meditative
discontent. Why does he <em>live</em>?
why does he continue his miserable
existence? is the only reflection which
the sufferings of another man excite
in our moody philosopher. For every
lamenting wretch he has daggers,
bowels of poison&mdash;no pity. If mankind
could commit one simultaneous,
universal act of suicide, it would be a
most sublime deed&mdash;perhaps the only
real act of wisdom and sublimity
mankind has it in its power to perform.</p>

<p>Well, this absurd and horrible, this
very ridiculous and most afflictive of
morbid conditions, our clear-minded
authoress never seems to have passed
through. She never gave the beggar
a shilling, muttering some advice to
buy a rope withal. If the money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
were spent in that way, and more
were wanted, he should have <em>two</em>.
She never lent her friend a brace of
pistols by way of consolation for his
losses. Or, since ladies, even when
misanthropically disposed, have seldom
anything to do with pistols, she never
wove or platted for him a silken bowstring,
and sent it in a perfumed envelope,
with compliments and instructions
how to use it. All this chapter
of mental history has been a sealed
book to her. We, for our parts, have
no desire to open or to read further
in it.</p>

<p>The happiest step made by those
whose temper and mode of thinking
were likely to be formed by practical
literature, was when they deserted
Byron for Wordsworth, the <cite>Childe
Harold</cite> for the <cite>Excursion</cite>. If we
were to indulge in "Recollections" of
our own, we should have much to
say&mdash;and to say with pleasure&mdash;of
this second epoch, this Wordsworthian
era. A very beautiful <cite>Flora</cite> appeared
upon the earth during this
period. Life smiled again; nature
and humanity were no longer divorced;
one might love the solitude
and beauty of hill and valley, lake
and river, without hating man, or
breathing any other sentiment than
that of gratitude to Him who gave
this life, who gave this nature.</p>

<p>Wordsworth was peculiarly fitted
to be the successor of Byron. He
had himself shared in the dark and
desponding spirit of the age just so
much as enabled him to understand
and portray it, to assail or to alleviate.
He had scanned the abyss looking
down from the precipice, but his feet
were well planted on the jutting rock.
He threw his vision down; he stood
firm himself. He drew many an inspiration
from the dark gulf below;
but nothing betrays that he had ever
plunged into the abyss. His poetry
will at all times have a genial influence,
but it can never again exert
the same power, or, as a consequence,
excite the same enthusiastic plaudits,
which it did amongst the generation
who have now advanced to manhood.
It then fell upon the ear of the tired
pupil of doubt and discontent. It
had a healing power; it was sweet
music, and it was more&mdash;it was a
charm that allayed a troubled spirit.</p>

<p>Why should any poet, it may be
asked, capable of moving the human
heart, exert so much more power at
one period than another? He has
but his book to conjure with; his book
is still, and always, with us. The
answer is very simple, and yet may
be worth recalling to mind. The
book is with us, but it is only when
it first comes forth that we are all
reading it <em>at once</em>. When numbers
are reading this same book at the
same time, the poet shares in the
advantages of the orator: he adresses
an audience who kindle each other's
passions, each one of whom contributes
something to the enthusiasm
of the multitude, and receives back in
his bosom the gathering enthusiasm
of the crowd. When novelty, or any
other circumstance, directs all eyes to
the same page, that page is no longer
read with the same calmness, the
same perspicuity and judgment, that
we bring to any other composition.
The enthusiasm of friends, of neighbours,
of the whole country, is added
to our own. And thus the genuine
poet may descend somewhat in public
estimation, and yet retain a lasting
claim upon our admiration. It was
one thing to read him when all the
world were reading too, talking of
him, and applauding him; and quite
another when the solitary student
takes down his book from the shelf
and reads it in its turn, and reads it
separately&mdash;he and the author alone
together.</p>

<p>One advantage of works of the
description we are now reviewing, is
that they bring together popular
specimens of the poetry of very different
ages. Miss Mitford gives us
a few from Cowley, and still earlier
writers. The impression they made
upon us led to some trains of thought
upon the manifest progress of taste,
which we have not space here to pursue,
and which would be wearisome
on the present occasion, if we were
to attempt to follow them out. But
we cannot help observing that even
quite secondary writers are daily
producing amongst us far better
verses, in every respect, than many of
those which have acquired, and seem
still to retain, a high traditional
celebrity. We are not altogether
blind, we think, to the literary foibles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
of our own age, although we cannot,
of course, hope to appreciate them as
clearly as those who come after us
will do. We suspect that the poets of
our own day are exposed to the
charge of vagueness, of being what is
sometimes called mystical, of verging
too closely, in their subtilty and
spiritual refinement, upon the land
of no-meaning; but this is "a better
bad habit" than that very mechanical
manner of verse-making, so obvious
in many of those specimens which are
handed down to us in our "Speakers,"
and "Elegant Extracts," as choice
selections from the old standard
poetry of England. The least possible
quantity of thought seems to
have sufficed for their manufacture;
one image suggests another, either by
resemblance or contrast; and thus
the writer goes on, contriving new
verses, with never a new thought.
If a pleasing image is introduced, it
is spoilt by the incessant <em>variations</em>
that are forthwith composed upon the
same theme; if a fine expression is
struck out, it is marred the next
moment by the mechanical changes
that are rung upon it. Here is a
noble line of Cowley's:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">
"Hail, old patrician trees, so great and good!"
</p>

<p class="noind">But you must read it alone: the next
line ruins it&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">
"Hail, old patrician trees, so great and good!<br />
<em>Hail, ye plebeian underwood!</em>"
</p>

<p class="noind">Having written the word "patrician,"
it followed, as a rule, that he must
look about for something to be called
"plebeian!"</p>

<p>Miss Mitford has placed amongst
her extracts the song by Richard
Lovelace, supposed to be written
when in prison, in which the well-known
lines occur:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Stone walls do not a prison make,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor iron bars a cage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Minds innocent and quiet take<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That for an hermitage."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">The mind being free, there is true
liberty. A very excellent theme for
the poet. In the first verse, speaking
of his "divine Althæa," he says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When I lie tangled in her hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And fettered with her eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>The birds, that wanton in the air</em>,<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><em>Know no such liberty</em>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">This is pretty; but unfortunately
the birds in the air suggest the fishes
in the sea. So the next verse concludes
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When thirsty grief in wine we steep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When healths and draughts go free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Fishes, that tipple in the deep</em>,<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><em>Know no such liberty</em>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We meet here also with that poem
attributed to Sir Walter Raleigh,
called "The Lie," which seems to
have a hereditary right to a place in
all poetical collections. Miss Mitford
speaks of "its extraordinary beauty."
It is a very extraordinary delusion
that any one, with such poetry before
him as the English language
now possesses, should call it beautiful.
It is composed of the mere commonplaces
of satire, very rudely put
together. The soul of the speaker is
sent forth to charge all the world with
corruption; the world defends itself,
and then the soul gives it the lie&mdash;in
other words, repeats the charge in a
manner which has been felt, it seems,
by many readers, to be peculiarly
pungent. The first verse is by far
the best, and every subsequent verse
seems to grow more loose and jejune
as the composition proceeds.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Go, soul, the body's guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon a thankless errand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear not to touch the best,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The truth shall be thy warrant.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Go, since I needs must die,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And give the world the lie.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Go tell the court it glows,<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><em>And shines like rotten wood</em>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go tell the church it shows<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><em>Men's good, and doth no good</em>:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">If church and court reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then give them both the lie."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">And so it goes on through thirteen
wrangling, jangling verses. In some
of them this virtuous soul makes a
strange medley of complaints:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tell them that brave it most<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They beg for more by spending,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who in their greatest cost<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lack nothing but commanding:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And if they make reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Spare not to give the lie.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tell zeal it lacks devotion;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tell love it is but lust;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Tell time it is but motion</em>;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tell flesh it is but dust:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And wish them not reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For thou must give the lie."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There must have been surely a
great charm in this "giving the lie,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
to have secured for verses such as
these the place they have so long retained
amongst our "Elegant Extracts."</p>

<p>But we are in danger of forgetting
that Miss Mitford's selections consist
of prose as well as of poetry; and yet,
though these occupy a large space in
her volumes, they cannot detain us
long. We have little room either for
quotation or for comment.</p>

<p>There is, however, one extract from
this portion of the work, which we
have all along promised ourselves the
pleasure of giving to our readers.
When we saw the name of Richardson,
the author of <cite>Sir Charles Grandison</cite>,
heading one of the chapters, our
only impulse was to hurry on as fast
as possible. We have no other association
with his name but that of a
mortal weariness, the result of a conscientious
but fruitless effort to read
his novels. We laboured conscientiously,
and might been have labouring
to this hour, if a kind friend had not
relieved us from our self-imposed task,
by his solemn assurance "that no
living man had read them!" It was
a feat that had not been accomplished
for years. When, therefore, we saw
the name of Samuel Richardson at the
head of a chapter, we ran for it&mdash;we
<em>skipped</em>; but, in turning over the
pages, the name of Klopstock caught
our eye, and we found ourselves reading
some letters of the wife of the
poet Klopstock which had been addressed
to Richardson. They are the
most charming of letters. The foreigner's
imperfect English could not
be replaced with advantage by the
most classical elegance. One of these,
we resolved, should lend its interest
to our own critical notice. Here it
is&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<i>Hamburg, May 6, 1758.</i>
</p>

<p>"It is not possible, sir, to tell you
what a joy your letters give me. My
heart is very able to esteem the favour,
that you in your venerable age are so
condescending good to answer so soon the
letters of an unknown young woman, who
has no other merit than a heart full of
friendship, though at so many miles of
distance.</p>

<p>"It will be a delightful occupation for
me, my dear Mr Richardson, to make you
more acquainted with my husband's poem.
Nobody can do it better than I, being the
person who knows the most of that which
is not yet published; being always present
at the birth of the young verses,
which begin always by fragments here
and there of a subject of which his soul
is just then filled. He has many great
fragments of the whole work ready. You
may think that two people, who love as
we do, have no need of two chambers.
We are always in the same. I, with my
little work, still, still, only regarding my
husband's sweet face, which is so venerable
at that time! with tears of devotion, and
all the sublimity of the subject&mdash;my husband
reading me his young verses, and
suffering my criticisms. Ten books are
published, which I think probably the
middle of the whole. I will, as soon as I
can, translate you the arguments of these
ten books, and what besides I think of
them. The verses of the poem are without
rhymes, and are hexameters, which
sort of verses my husband has been the
first to introduce in our language; we
being still closely attached to the rhymes
and the iambics.</p>

<p>"And our dear Dr Young has been so
ill? But he is better, I thank God, along
with you. And you, my dear, dear friend,
have not hope of cure of a severe nervous
malady? How I trembled as I read it!
I pray God to give to you, at the least,
patience and alleviation. Though I can
read very well your handwriting, you
shall write no more, if it is incommodious
to you. Be so good to dictate only to
Mrs Patty; it will be very agreeable for
me to have so amiable a correspondent.
And then I will still more than now preserve
the two of your own handwriting
as treasures.</p>

<p>"I am very glad, sir, that you will
take my English as it is. I knew very
well that it may not always be English,
but I thought for you it was intelligible.
My husband asked me, as I was writing
my first letter, if I would not write in
French? 'No,' said I, 'I will not write
in this pretty but <em>fade</em> language to Mr
Richardson.'...</p>

<p>"I wish, sir. I could fulfil your request
of bringing you aquainted with so many
good people as you think of. Though I
love my friends dearly, and though they
are good, I have, however, much to pardon,
except in the single Klopstock alone.
<em>He</em> is good, really good&mdash;good at the
bottom&mdash;in all the foldings of his heart.
I know him; and sometimes I think, if
we knew others in the same manner, the
better we should find them. For it may
be that an action displeases us, which
would please us if we knew its true aim
and whole extent. No one of my friends
is so happy as I am; but no one has
had courage to marry as I did. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
have married as people marry, and they
are happy as people are happy.</p>

<p>"How long a letter is this again!
But I can write no short ones to you.
Compliments from my husband," &amp;c., &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are several of these letters,
and all distinguished by the same
tenderness and charming simplicity;
and the sad fate and early death of
the writer of them are brought home
to us very touchingly.</p>

<p>We have shown enough to justify
our opinion, that every reader, whatever
his peculiar taste may be, will
find something to interest him in these
volumes; and if, we repeat, he feels
the least degree of disappointment, it
will only be because he compares
them with that imaginary work which
he believes Miss Mitford <em>might</em> have
written.</p>

<h3>PART III.</h3>


<h4>CHAPTER X.</h4>

<p>I saw nothing of Catsbach for a
whole week, but continued my study
of Hamlet, in perfect reliance that
the so long wished-for opportunity
was at hand. Miss Claribel also
was very constant at our rehearsals.
My mother's delight and admiration of
us both knew no bounds; but though
she still wept at Ophelia, it was evident
that the philosophic Dane was her
favourite. In gratitude for my exertions
to revenge my father's death,
she forgave any little demonstration
of rudeness I made towards the
Queen; and indeed was always greatly
rejoiced when I shook the cushion out
of the arm-chair in the energy of my
expostulation with that ancient piece
of furniture, which generally did duty
for the wicked Gertrude. In fact,
nothing could go off better than the
whole play; and boxes, pit, and
gallery, all represented by one enraptured
spectator, were unanimous
in their applause. There was one of
the performers, however, who did
not seem to share in the enthusiasm.
Miss Claribel appeared discontented
with the effects of her finest points,
and began to hint her doubts as to
our ultimate success. "The words
are perfect in both of us," she said,
"the actions appropriate, and all
Hamlet's own instructions to the
players scrupulously obeyed"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well," I interrupted, "what is
there to fear? You see how our
audience here is affected."</p>

<p>"It is that very thing that gives
me uneasiness. Nature on the stage
is quite different from nature off it.
Whether it ought to be so or not, I
don't know; but it is so, and that is
enough. We give the passion of these
characters as they affect ourselves,
but a real actor must give them as
they affect others. We ought to study
the perspective of grief or rage, and
give it so as to be seen in the true
light, not where Mrs de Bohun is
sitting on that sofa, but where crowds
are seated at the farther end of a
theatre; and therefore the great and
almost insurmountable difficulty of a
tragedian is to keep such a proportion
in his performance as not to appear
absurdly exaggerated to people close
at hand, or ridiculously tame to the
more distant spectators."</p>

<p>"You would, then, act by an inspiration
from without, and not from
the divine fire within?" I answered,
with a tone of indignation.</p>

<p>"No, no," she said; "keep all the
fire you can; only let it be seen and
felt by all the audience. But if you
trust on each representation to the
fiery impulse of the moment, you
will sometimes find it glow too much,
and sometimes it will probably be
hidden in smoke. The genius feels
the passion and grandeur of a great
Shaksperian creation, perhaps as
entirely as Shakspeare himself, but
it is only the artist who can place it
before others. A poet could see the
Venus of Canova in a block of marble,
but it was the hammer and chisel of
the sculptor which gave it its
immortal form. I feel with regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
to this very Ophelia that I know
every phase of her character; that I
can identify myself with her disappointments
and sorrows; but the
chances are, after the identity is
established, that I end by making
Ophelia into Miss Claribel, and not
Miss Claribel into Ophelia."</p>

<p>"No, for you speak Shakspeare's
language in Ophelia's situation, and
with Ophelia's feelings."</p>

<p>"But with Miss Claribel's lips,
and shakings of the voice, and tears
in the eyes, which arise from the
depths of Miss Claribel's nature; and,
in fact, I now feel convinced that, in
order to succeed on the stage, a flexibility
of character that enables one
to enter into the minutest sentiments
of the personage of the drama, is by
no means required, but only such a
general conception of the character as
preserves the Shaksperian heroine
from the individualities of her representative;
and gives to an intelligent
pit, the spectacle not of a real,
living, breathing woman, born of
father and mother, but of a being of
a more etherial nature&mdash;human, yet
not substantial&mdash;divine, yet full of
weakness&mdash;the creation of a splendid
imagination, and not the growth of
mortal years, or supported by 'human
nature's daily food.'"</p>

<p>My mother went on with her
knitting in a most hurried and persevering
manner&mdash;a habit she indulged
in whenever she was puzzled.
I might have followed her example
if I had had the knitting needles in
my hand, for I did not see the drift
of these perplexing observations.
Miss Claribel saw our bewilderment,
and translated her dark passages into
ordinary prose by saying that her
oration had been a lecture against
mannerism, or the display of the
individualities of an actor instead of
a clear development of the character
represented. "It was also a theory,"
she added with a smile, "that
mannerism often arises from a too
close appropriation of a character,
which makes a performer assimilate
it with his own."</p>

<p>"From all which I conclude," I
said, with a mortified air, "that in
spite of black bugles and silk stockings,
I shall still be Mr Charles de Bohun,
and not Hamlet, prince of Denmark."</p>

<p>"'The hands are not the hands of
Esau,'" she replied, "'but the voice
is the voice of Jacob.' Still there is no
reason to despair, nor even perhaps
to augur a disappointment, for nobody
can form an opinion either as to
success or failure till the experiment
has been fairly tried, and I trust we
shall now not have much longer to
wait."</p>

<p>"But with these misgivings&mdash;to call
them by the gentlest name&mdash;I wonder,
Miss Claribel, you still insist on
trying your fortune on the boards."</p>

<p>"I made a vow, under very peculiar
circumstances," she replied, "that
I would support myself by my
dramatic powers; and though a
fortune of millions were to fall at my
feet to-morrow, I would show those
who derided my ambition that it was
justified by my talents. I will be an
actress, and the first on the stage!"</p>

<p>When I saw the play of her
features, and heard the calm, subdued
energy of her voice, I felt little doubt
that her prophecy would be accomplished.
I, however, began to feel
some very lively doubts as to Hamlet,
and it required several criticisms from
my mother, and a great deal of
stamping and grimacing before the
mirror, to restore me to the enjoyment
of the sunshine of self-respect.
At last Catsbach returned. He sent
to announce his arrival, and to say he
would join me that evening, and bring
with him a literary friend, who might
be very useful to me in my dramatic
career. They came. "Let me introduce
you to my friend, Mr Wormwood,
the orator and poet," said Catsbach,
shaking me by the hand very
warmly himself. "You will be the
best friends in the world; and Wormwood
has been very anxious for a long
time to make your acquaintance."
The stranger bowed low, and so did
I; not without a strong tickling of my
vanity at the wideness of my reputation.
We sat down, and I could contemplate
my visitor at full leisure.
He was a little man, of whom the
prevailing feature was a nose of astonishing
prominence, that overshadowed
not only the remaining features of
his face, but the whole of his person.
It formed the central point of his
whole organisation, and was, in fact,
Mr Wormwood, without the help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
either of face or figure. His brow
retreated in apparent alarm, pulling
the eyebrows with it nearly to the
top of the skull; his chin also had
retired into his neck, and there was
nothing visible but the one prevailing
feature&mdash;a pyramid in a waste of sand.
The sudden retrocession of his brow
was only seen in profile; and as he
was bald, and treated all the exposed
skin of his head as forehead up to the
very crown, he presented a very intellectual
appearance in the eyes of
those with whom high brows are considered
"the dome of thought, the
temple of the soul." His side hair
was carefully combed off, so as to expose
as great an expanse as possible;
and it was evident that great pains
were bestowed on the picturesqueness
and poetry of the appearance&mdash;a
small thin man, rather shabbily drest,
and with manners duly compounded
of civility and pomp.</p>

<p>"I am delighted to know you,
Mr De Bohun. I form a very high
estimate, indeed, of your genius and
accomplishments; though I have not
yet had the pleasure of seeing any of
your works."</p>

<p>"I am indebted to the good opinion&mdash;too
much indebted, I fear&mdash;of
our friend, Mr Catsbach," I replied.</p>

<p>"By no means. You have had a
play ignominiously rejected by a brutal
and unjudging world. Sir, I honour
you on the triumph, and congratulate
you on the success."</p>

<p>The man seemed quite serious as
he spoke; so I looked for some explanation
to his friend.</p>

<p>"Wormwood has achieved the
same victory on several occasions,"
said Catsbach; "and on carefully
going over his plays, according to the
severest principles of art, he finds that
they were ludicrously and inhumanly
laughed at, or still more inhumanly
refused a place on the stage, in exact
proportion as their merits lifted them
above the intellectual level of an audience,
or the narrow understanding
of a manager."</p>

<p>"Exactly so," said Wormwood;
"and you will find it uniformly the
case. Success in literature is almost
the surest sign of an author's imbecility;
and, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à fortiori</i>, public neglect a
sign of his genius and erudition. I
have already heard that your tragedy
is refused; I hope to congratulate you
on your Hamlet being hissed off the
stage."</p>

<p>"Really, sir," I said, somewhat
nettled, "I scarcely understand whether
you are in jest or earnest; and I
sincerely hope to escape your congratulations
on my Hamlet, as I am not
aware of any right I have acquired
to them on the fate of the play."</p>

<p>"Was it not returned on your
hands, sir? Catsbach certainly gave
me to understand that you had attained
that mark of eminence; but if
you are still in danger of being accepted,
and performed, I must withhold
the expression of my praise till
I see whether an audience will be
more propitious than the manager,
and overwhelm your tragedy with
derision and contempt, as I have no
doubt it deserves." After accompanying
this with a smile, which he
evidently meant to be propitiatory
and complimentary, he seemed to retire
for shelter behind his nose, and
employed himself in throwing on each
side any of the straggling locks that
intruded on the sacred domain of his
expansive brow.</p>

<p>"What sort of fool is this you have
brought?" I said to Catsbach, availing
myself of the temporary seclusion
of our visitor behind the promontory
I have described.</p>

<p>"A tremendous author, I assure
you. A poem in forty books, called
'The Brides of Solomon,' which nearly
ruined him, for it never sold, not
even to the cheesemongers; a 'History
of the World previous to its
Creation, an Epic in Seven Days,"
which it would take seven years to
read, was his next; then a dozen
plays on the Roman Emperors&mdash;a
play to each&mdash;which were never acted;
so now he is a prodigious critic in the
Hog in Armour, and talks German
mysticism, and gives dissertations on
the Philosophy of Historic Research
in a review of Tom Thumb. I thought
it as well to secure his help; for, if
you succeed, we can do without him;
and if we fail, he will find out a pleasant
reason, and enlist you in the
corps."</p>

<p>"That would be an honour I don't
aspire to, and the use of such assistance
I cannot see."</p>

<p>"Pooh! Never mind the fool. Give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
him some brandy; let him talk; he
may be useful, and the day of trial is
near at hand."</p>

<p>"You've got a theatre?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Theatre, orchestra, company, and
all," said Catsbach; "so let us light
our cigars, and hear some critical
drivel."</p>

<p>Mr Wormwood, as if he had heard
our conversation, emerged from his
shady situation, and turning his full
face towards us, commenced a dissertation
on his principles of art, which,
being founded on, and exemplified by,
his own writings, was a most comfortable
doctrine for candidates for
fame, and made a pelting with oranges
and apples little less agreeable than a
crowning with garlands and a shower
of bouquets.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER XI.</h4>

<p>"This will be a busy week, big
with the fate of more than Cato or of
Rome," said Catsbach next day. "I
have secured, for a very moderate
sum, the use of a theatre down the
river; and dresses, advertisements,
and decorations are promised us on
the most splendid scale. All the second-rates
I have already retained, being,
in fact, the regular company of the
establishment; and I assure you they
are all in the highest state of excitement
about the new Hamlet and
your friend Miss What's-her-name's
Ophelia."</p>

<p>"Her name is Miss Claribel," I
replied; "and I can't imagine how
you take so little interest in a person
whom I consider so wonderful, as to
have forgotten it."</p>

<p>"Pardon, my dear fellow, I meant
no offence either to her powers or
your discernment; but I probably
forgot what you called her, from a very
strong idea I entertain that her name
is fictitious. Don't you remember
the Montalbans and De la Roses of
the Stepney Star? Her name is
Jones."</p>

<p>"How? Have you made any inquiry?"
I exclaimed, rather astonished
myself at the interest I took
in the personal history of the beautiful
actress.</p>

<p>"O! that's it, is it?" said Catsbach,
with a shrug. "What! She
has played Ophelia to the perfect
satisfaction of Polonius. She knows
you are heir of the De Bohuns."</p>

<p>"Polonius! My dear Mr Tooks,
what can you possibly mean? You
remember that Polonius is the father
of Ophelia."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose Miss Claribel
has a father also, or some person who
takes a tender interest in her prosperity.
They are very often captains
in the army, those Poloniuses of modern
life; and are a little more strict
in exacting an adhesion to promise,
than the courtier of Elsinore. I therefore
advise all Hamlets to be very
cautious how they put pen to paper,
or request a lady to be an astronomical
heretic as to the sun and stars,
but never to doubt their love; for,
when Polonius is too old or too ill for
work, there is generally a Laertes or
two who are masters of fence, and
very careful of their sisters' settlements."</p>

<p>"You try to put suspicions into
my head. I will not yield to them. I
feel sure you would not harbour the
slightest doubt of her perfect openness
and sincerity, if you only saw her
for, half an hour."</p>

<p>"Possibly enough, if I only saw
her for half an hour: what a few days
might do, is a different question. In
the mean time, I will bet your bill to
Montalban that she turns out a deceiver,
worming her way into your
mother's favour by false representations,
and into her son's, by arts
which it does not need many months
of the Stepney Star to bring to perfection."</p>

<p>"Done!" I said; "with all my
heart! I would stake all I have on
her perfect truth. See her, and judge
for yourself."</p>

<p>"I shall see her at the theatre in
plenty of time to prevent any mischief;
but, in the meanwhile, I rely on
your assistance to-night at a ball in
Grosvenor Square, where I positively
require you to complete the band."</p>

<p>Our agreement was so binding that
it was useless to offer any opposition. I
began to look on my flute as a frightful
instrument of degradation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
thought what a different position I
ought to have filled on my first introduction
to the society of Grosvenor
Square. The position of the temporary
orchestra, at the window of the
middle drawing-room, gave me a view
of the whole company, both in the
front room, which was very large and
lofty, and the more commodious and
luxuriously fitted up third apartment,
at the left of where I sat. A city
Cr&oelig;sus was the giver of the feast,&mdash;a
short thin man, very pale and very
silent, who stood at the centre door,
and bowed coldly and formally to his
visitors as they were announced. His
lady-wife, on the other hand, was as
gorgeous as feathers and silk could
make her; an immense expanse of
humanity, covered with at least an
equal expanse of pride, for she sailed
through the apartments as if the
weight of empires, or at least the price
of kingdoms, lay on her shoulders;
and round her gathered, at respectful
distance, the lesser plumb-holders
of the commercial world, like a set of
yachts and merchantmen round a
first-rate at Spithead. Mrs Willox
was quite aware of the position she
held, and made no secret that a cousin
of hers had married an Irish baronet,
and that her aunt was the widow of a
city knight. Connected to this extent
with the aristocracy, she felt she had
a right to look down on Mr Willox,
who had begun his career as purser in
an Indiaman, and accordingly she
looked down upon him from morn to
night. At my left hand stood two
gentlemen, pilloried so immovably in
white neckcloths that they could not
turn their heads without an effort that
made them red in the face. Two
young patricians they were from the
India Docks, whose conversation was
very loud about their shootings in
Scotland, and hunting-boxes at Melton.
This enlivening conversation,
though apparently addressed to each
other, was in reality intended for me.
So fond of admiration are some of our
weaker brothers, that they will angle
for it even from a professional player
on the flute. They soon saw that I
attended to what they were saying,
and they launched out into various
subjects, evidently for my improvement
and edification. "Sir Peter,
and Lady Potts, and Miss Emmeline
Potts," were announced in stentorian
sounds, and Mr Willox made his
customary bow.</p>

<p>"That Emmeline Potts," said one
of my instructors, "is no go. She
has been trying it on with Harry
Buglefield of the Guards; but the
father won't fork out the coin, and
Harry fights shy. He told me so
himself when I was selling him my
brown filly last season in Leicestershire."</p>

<p>"He ought to give her a hundred
thousand down," said the other, "and
the rest when he's run to earth; but
he's a jaded old screw, and can't last
long. I would advise Harry to wait."</p>

<p>"He says he's very willing to wait
if his creditors could be persuaded to
wait too. A fine generous fellow as
ever lived; and a very intimate friend
of mine. He has never paid me a
farthing for the brown filly, though
he sold her to his uncle, Lord Silliveer,
at a profit of a hundred and
fifty."</p>

<p>"Mr Hoddie, and the two Miss
Hoddie's!" bawled the footman at
the drawing-room door, and the individuals
announced sailed into the
room. Dancing was now in full force,
so that I missed the first appearance
of the party, but I heard the criticism
of the two arbiters of fashion on
my left.</p>

<p>"That Malvina Hoddie is the vainest
little fool in England," said the
senior Petronius, whose name was
Baggles, to Mr Hooker&mdash;both in the
West India trade&mdash;as expectant heirs
and successors of their respective
fathers. "She believes every word
that a fellow says to her, and tells
her father all the soft speeches from
her partner, as if they were proposals
of marriage. Hoddie is therefore for
ever sending letters to ascertain what
men's intentions are, as, after the
very warm manner in which his little
darling was informed that the hope
of meeting her was the only thing
that kept Mr So-and-so from committing
suicide, if not murder, it is
impossible to doubt that Mr So-and-so
cannot intend to leave matters as
they are."</p>

<p>"What an old fool," replied Mr
Hooker. "Why didn't you tell me
this before? for I met her last night
in Harley Street, at the Molasses'; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
when she put up her absurd little face
to my shirt pin, when we were in the
middle of the Row Polka, and asked
if I didn't think love in a cottage was
better than a gay and festive scene
like this, I said, 'Ah! certainly, if you
had the choice of the partner of your
bliss.' 'Do you mean it?' she lisped,
and looked very hard at me. 'Certainly,'
I said. 'Papa will be so delighted,'
she continued, and swung
round, with her chin fairly resting on
my shoulder; and when the dance
was over, tript up to the old snob, on
which I took the opportunity of rushing
out of the house."</p>

<p>"You'll get a note to-morrow
morning, to a certainty, demanding
what your next step is to be; and
then, if you shuffle out, they will be
very industrious in circulating a report
that you have been ignominiously
rejected."</p>

<p>"There she goes," exclaimed
Hooker, "dancing with Hugs of
Blackwall. I hope she'll catch him,
for it would be very awkward if she
spread any nonsensical report about
my having either proposed for her,
or being rejected."</p>

<p>"It might be very unpleasant, old
fellow," replied Mr Baggles, "if it
reached the good people at Muswell
Hill."</p>

<p>"Mr, Mrs, and Miss Pybus!"
shouted out the St Peter of the drawing-room
door; and the well-remembered
name gave me such a shock
that in a moment my accompaniment
attenuated itself into a feeble whistle,
and suddenly the music stopped. I
looked at Catsbach, who returned my
look with no very complimentary expression,
as he discovered that the
astonished dancers, and, in fact, the
whole brilliant assemblage of the fair
and brave, had fixed their eyes on the
performers. The whistle, also, in
which I had concluded my musical
exercise, was so irresistibly ludicrous,
that there was a wonderful display of
white teeth, and a not very inaudible
laugh.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the band?"
inquired Mr Willox, coming up, red
with rage. "Mr Conductor, you must
have, at all events, one very poor performer
in your number, which, considering
the sum you charge, I consider
inexcusable&mdash;quite inexcusable, sir. I
insist on your turning him out, or, at
all events, telling him to be quiet the
rest of the evening."</p>

<p>"Encore!" exclaimed Mr Catsbach,
striking his bow across the
fiddle. "Donner und blitzen!&mdash;der
teufel!&mdash;now, den!" and the dancing
was once more resumed. So I sat
silent and horror-struck, with my
flute lying quietly on the ledge of the
music-desk before me. I had blackened
my eyebrows, and wore a false
beard, with a tuft on the lower lip.
There was no chance of recognition,
and I had a curiosity to see the gentleman
who had been so generous and
friendly at the examination of Puddlecombe-Regis
school. I was anxious,
also, to see the beautiful little girl who
had made such an impression on the
hearts of all the scholars, and deepest,
perhaps of all, on mine.</p>

<p>"Very odd," continued Mr Baggles,
renewing the conversation with his
friend, "that we should be speaking
of the Pybuses at the very moment
they made their appearance. Emily,
I suppose, would never forgive you if
she thought you cared a straw for
Malvina Hoddie?"</p>

<p>"She would be very severe," replied
Mr Hooker. "She's very sharp,
and can say such cutting things." At
which words he seemed to shudder,
as if at some appalling recollection of
her powers of repartee.</p>

<p>"Why don't you read <cite>Punch</cite> and
<cite>Joe Miller</cite>, and learn to retort? She's
very young, and ought to be put
down."</p>

<p>"She doesn't think sixteen so
very young; and as she is the pet at
home, and an immense heiress, it is
not so very easy to gain a victory
over her, if you were as witty as the
Honourable Bob Chockers of the
Blues."</p>

<p>"Your true plan is to keep in with
the father. He is a jolly old ass, and
very fond of high society. If you
were a lord, you might have Emily for
the asking."</p>

<p>"I know a good many lords," replied
Mr Hooker, "and that's the
next thing to being one myself. But
here comes Emily and the ancients."</p>

<p>O, the change that two years
produce on a girl of fourteen!&mdash;two
years of health, and wealth, and education!
There came towards us, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the outer drawing-room, a figure as
perfect as ever was revealed to sculptor&mdash;with
intelligence and sweetness
radiating from a countenance such as
no sculptor could ever fix in marble.
She did not walk, she touched the floor
with her feet, and seemed to repress
a bound at every step, that would
have sent her dancing in like a Hebe
holding forth a wine-cup, or like one
of the nymphs of Venus, who are all
far prettier, I beg to say, than Venus
herself&mdash;tripping forward and scattering
roses on the pathway of the goddess.
Never did I see so radiant a
beauty, combined (when you examined
the features, the firm lip, and
high imperial brow) with as much
dignity and power. The dignity and
power were hidden, to be sure, below
the transparent veil of her sixteen
summers; but there they were, ready
to expand when that veil was removed&mdash;a
dissolving view, as it were,
where the solid outlines and severe majesty
of a Grecian temple were already
faintly visible over the disappearing
lineaments of a bower in fairyland.
From this glorious apparition I looked
to Mr Hooker&mdash;good features, but inexpressive;
eyes blue and feeble;
nose finely chiselled, but effeminate;
lips well shaped, but uneducated; and
a bearing mock-easy, mock-aristocratic&mdash;loud,
conceited, contemptible! I
could have killed him with ineffable
delight.</p>

<p>Her father was unchanged; the
same stately presence, the same benevolent
smile, the same appearance of
having Golconda in one pocket, and
the Bank of England in the other,
and a chuckle in his voice as if his
throat was filled with guineas. How
is it, thought I, as I looked at the
father and daughter, that wealth
always softens and refines the woman,
while it only swells out and amplifies
the man? In the man, we see the
counting-house resisting, or ill accommodating
itself to the drawing-room.
There is either an uneasy effort to
escape from the ledger, or a still more
painful attempt to convert it into a
book of fashionable life. He has had
fights about sugar in the morning, disquisitions
with underwriters, reports
of bankruptcies in Ceylon, of short
crops in Jamaica, or a fall in the
funds in Mexico, and he finds it impossible
to give himself up entirely to
the careless enjoyment of an evening
assemblage of friends, and yet cannot
relieve his mind by making the objects
of his thoughts the subject of his conversation.
So he takes to political
talk, by way of doing the genteel, and
discusses Lord George, or Sir Robert,
or Lord John, in the violent effort he
makes to escape from indigo and muscovadoes.
With the daughter how different!
Here wealth merely represents
the absence of those petty and worrying
annoyances which narrow the circle
of thought, when a grim vision of
the weekly bills is seldom long absent
from the mind. She has magnificence,
luxury, refinement all round her, and
imbibes a grace from the very furniture
and ornaments of her room. A
blue sea with its tossing waves, by
Stanfield, insinuates its life and freshness
into her habitual thoughts&mdash;vases
from the antique, statues from Canova,
and flowers from Chiswick, are
her daily and homely companions.
Her nature gets raised to what it works
in; and though her mother is not very
intimate with Lindley Murray, and
her father has some strange ideas
about the letter H, she is as graceful,
as pure, and elegant, as if she could
trace up her lineage to the Plantagenets.</p>

<p>"O, such a funny thing!" said Mr
Hooker, as Emily came up to where
he stood. "Your very name made a
conquest of one of the fiddlers, and
he broke down the moment you came
in. He'll get such a wigging from
his commander-in-chief."</p>

<p>"Was it only one?" inquired
Emily. "I thought the whole band
had come to a stop."</p>

<p>"The poor young fellow with the
flute put 'em all out," replied Hooker.
"He went off in such a scream, as if
the drawing-room was hurrying right
into a tunnel. He has never held his
head up since."</p>

<p>"Poor man," said Emily; "which
is it?"</p>

<p>"That foreign-looking, bewhiskered
lad, with the pale face next to us. A
bad job for him, I guess."</p>

<p>"O no! As you say my coming
in was the cause of his misfortune, I
must try and not let it be too serious."</p>

<p>In spite of all my efforts to appear
ignorant of the conversation, I found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
my cheeks growing alternately red and
white, as anger or confusion got the upper
hand. I took up my flute, and had
thoughts of suddenly leaving the room&mdash;of
knocking Mr Hooker down&mdash;of
introducing myself to Mr Pybus; but
before I could make up my mind what
to do, I felt that her voice was addressed
to me. I felt it, I say, for I
did not look to where she was. I
looked upon vacancy, and must
have had an intellectual expression on
my countenance congenial to that
interesting employment.</p>

<p>"He doesn't hear me," she said to
Hooker. "Perhaps he doesn't understand
English."</p>

<p>"Hollo! you sir," said the gentleman,
"don't you hear the lady speaking
to you? Do you only sprichen
Dutch or parley-vous?"</p>

<p>His hand was laid roughly on my
shoulder to call my attention to his
speech. I half sprang up, shook off
his hand as if it had been a toad
and was on the point of saying or
doing something very absurd, when I
was checked by the alarmed look of
Emily, who evidently thought I was
going to commit murder on the unfortunate
object of my wrath.</p>

<p>"The dooce is in the fellow," said
Mr Hooker; "he couldn't look more
lofty were he a prince in disguise."</p>

<p>"Will you pardon me, madam,
that I did not hear you when you did
me the honour to address me?" I said.</p>

<p>"I merely regretted that your flute
played false a few minutes ago, and
prevented me from the pleasure of
hearing its accompaniment. It seems
a beautiful instrument. I suppose
the keys are very apt to get out of
order?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and the slightest tremor in
hand or breath is fatal."</p>

<p>"Of course, that holds good in all
musical performances. Have you professed
music long?"</p>

<p>"Not long."</p>

<p>"It requires immense practice to
excel in it&mdash;longer time and harder
study than would make a first classman
at Oxford, I have heard it said;
and, after all, the reward of it is
very poor."</p>

<p>I sat horror-struck. Did the girl
recognise me, and twit me with the
profession I had chosen, as well as the
career I had refused?</p>

<p>"No profession is poorly paid," I
replied, "that brings with it independence
and self-respect."</p>

<p>"O, surely not. Do you give lessons?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Ah! many people refuse to become
teachers from false pride, and a notion
that it degrades. I don't think so.
Do you?"</p>

<p>What was I to say? The girl certainly
had discovered me in spite of
beard and eyebrow. I looked at her
full in the face. No&mdash;there was no
consciousness there. Nothing but
kindness, and a strange look of compassion,
with which it was impossible
to take offence, for there was an
appearance of deep interest in it, which
was flattering to my self-love.</p>

<p>"Madam, I have never hitherto
thought of having pupils."</p>

<p>"O, but you will now. I have
long been anxious for a flute accompaniment
to my piano. I will speak
to papa."</p>

<p>"Miss Pybus," whispered Mr
Hooker, "if you have had a long
enough conversation with that fiddler,
will you fulfil your promise of dancing
with me this dance?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," she said&mdash;"I never
draw back from my promise;" and I
was left alone. In one of the pauses
of the dance I saw her speak to her
father. He expanded into a smile like
a gigantic sunflower, and chucked
her under the chin, and away she
went, still followed by that beaming
smile. I grew tired of watching the
happiness of Mr Hooker, and was
about to slip noiselessly away&mdash;Mr
Pybus glowed up to where I stood.</p>

<p>"My daughter tells me you have
no objection to give her a few lessons
on music, and accompany her on
the flute," he said.</p>

<p>"I am not aware, sir," I began. But
at this moment I saw Emily's eye
fixed on me as she moved towards
us in the dance.</p>

<p>"Well, well, if she's quite satisfied
with your proficiency, I am. Come
up on Friday to Muswell Hill, Holly-Hock
House&mdash;Mr Pybus. Here's
my card; we have a party on that
evening, and you can begin by accompanying
the piano. Hire a cab, and
let me know your expenses. We
shall not fall out about terms."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"I really, sir, scarcely know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, any one will point out Holly-Hock
House," said the father. "The
cabman is sure to know it."</p>

<p>"I am so happy you have agreed
to come," said the daughter, who had
again careered within earshot of our
talk. "I shall expect you on Friday."</p>

<p>What was to be done? I bowed&mdash;and
the bargain was closed.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER XII.</h4>

<p>I must have been asleep when
Catsbach came home, if that night
he came home at all. Frightful dreams
haunted me all night. A thousand demons
came down on me, like the
Guards at Waterloo, all playing on
broken-winded flutes. Twenty Hamlets,
all in sable hat and tumbled silk
stockings, whistled "To be, or not to
be," through the same detestable instrument.
Then I dreamt of Emily
Pybus, and instantly she turned into
Miss Claribel in the costume of
Ophelia. All the scenes of my past
life jumbled themselves up into one
confused mass. Well-known faces
looked in upon me from all sides of
the room&mdash;Mr Montalban, the old
schoolmaster at Puddlecombe, the
examiners, Miss de la Rose, and
Fitz-Edward&mdash;all piping and screaming
on that inevitable flute. It showed
that a deep blow on my vanity had
been inflicted by my failure at Mr
Willox's ball. I tried when I awoke
to remember whether I had taken
opium, I felt so feverish and confused;
but the excitement was caused by my
injured self-love; and, waking as well
as sleeping, I entertained a frantic
hatred against Mr Hooker. I determined
to take counsel of Catsbach,
to whom I had hitherto confided
all parts of my history, with the sole
concealment of names. I resolved to
lay the whole case before him, and
ask his advice how to proceed.
Should I go to Muswell Hill and take
the very office of tutor in music which
I had already so indignantly refused
in literature and classics? I found
I was very much changed since then&mdash;or
rather that Emily was more
attractive, as a pupil, than I had
thought her at fourteen years old.
There was romance also in becoming
acquainted with her in a fictitious
character; and I felt less degraded as
an unsuccessful musician than I had felt
as a disappointed schoolboy. But
Catsbach should decide upon it all.
In the morning, however, a note was
put into my hands&mdash;"The incident
last night," he said, "makes it too
dangerous for us to attend at private
parties. You will never be able to
preserve your incog. I have got some
intimation of the whereabouts of Ellinor.
You won't see me for two days.
Meantime, go on with rehearsal with
Miss Claribel, and on Thursday take
her to Chatham. The 'Paragon
Royal' will be in ecstasy at your approach,
for I have said you will give
them five pounds and a supper after
the play. I shall be there in plenty
of time for the overture, but at present
I am off to Guildford, where
I suspect my charmer keeps a school.
The mistress has been described to
me as a perfect angel; and what can
be a closer description of my Ellinor?
Take care of Miss Claribel's arts.
Beauty is a fading flower. So am
I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Augustus Tooks</span>." I followed
the advice contained in this letter,
and perfected myself in Hamlet. Miss
Claribel herself began to have hopes
of my success; and my mother, in
the midst of her rapture with my
performance, only insisted more and
more on a strict preservation of my
incognito. My uncle, she said, was
about to return to England. She did
not know how he might like to hear
that his nephew had gone upon the
stage. The Paragon Royal had
scarcely a grander sound than the
Stepney Star. Critics might be hostile;
for all literary people, she heard,
were unjust; and, at all events, I was
to appear as Julian Gray till my
position was fairly assured, and I
could announce myself as the Shakspeare
and Garrick of modern times.
I smiled at all these cautions; I
smiled at the hostility of the critics;
I frowned at the possibility of a
failure; I started when I heard her
allusion to my uncle; in fact, I found
that I was a regular playactor, and
that I went through the gamut of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
stamps and facemakings exactly like
Messrs Martingdale and Fitz-Edward.
Miss Claribel laughed. "You rehearse
very well," she said, "even when you
are not repeating your part. You
have immense command of feature, as
much, I should say, as Grimaldi; but
then he never attempted the tragic."</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand your
meaning, Miss Claribel," I said,
looking as dignified as Coriolanus
when he banished the Romans. "Do
you mean that I grimace too much?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you grimace at all.
There is no surer sign of a man
being a mere actor, than a reliance on
scorning lips and upturned eyebrows.
It is not natural. The words and
passion must force their own way
from the heart, and make their mark
on the countenance at the moment of
the burst. When you see a man
throw himself back with his arms
stretched out, his one leg forward,
his mouth gaping, and his eyes ready
to fall out of his head, in expectation
of a ghost or some other dreadful
sight, he is a mere conventional
figure of fright, with no terror or
apprehension whatever within. He
should wait for the apparition; he
should show the pit the first glimpse
he gets of it; through his eyes they
should see the undefined horror grow
into consistency; and without the
palpable presence either of the murdered
Banquo or of Hamlet's father,
they should feel a graveyard air
about them, and see the dreadful
shadow take shape and form. This is
not produced by starts and grins."</p>

<p>"Then, in heaven's name! how is
it produced?"</p>

<p>"By feeling it, by seeing it, by
believing it."</p>

<p>"I feel it, see it, believe it, and
my eyebrows ascend, my mouth
opens, my arms stretch out."</p>

<p>"So they would if you saw a
house on fire. These are the hereditary
exponents of surprise and fear;
but a ghost creates a different feeling;
it ought to be differently expressed:
not surprise&mdash;it is above it:
not fear&mdash;for neither Macbeth nor
Hamlet are capable of such a feeling;
but awe&mdash;something very different
from any other state of mind they
ever experienced before. They should
move little, speak low, make no faces,
and, above all things, show that the
sentiment comes from within. It
will find its way, by sympathy, to
the pit. They will see the propriety
of making little noise in presence
of a murdered general or a buried
king. Martingdale roars as if he
were in presence of a murdered bull,
and was triumphing over its death.
He bellows as if he felt he had conquered
a rival, and now had all the
noise to himself. But more: I
would invest the whole character of
Hamlet with an atmosphere of the
supernatural. No man who had held
parley with the dead, and was marshalled
on to a great act by invisible
hands, should ever be without an
impression of the awful presence. I
would make him throw inquiring
glances round, even in his talk with
the gravedigger. That ghost should
never leave the eyes of the pit; present
or absent, the supernatural should
rule the stage. When Hamlet is
silent, he should be <em>distrait</em>&mdash;inattentive
to what is going on, and
holding inward converse with his
unearthly visitor. Don't you think
he went really mad? To be sure he
did. Who wouldn't, if night and day
he were haunted by a ghost, commanding
him to commit a murder,
to revenge a father, to break the
heart of the girl who loved him? Of
course he went mad, though I don't
found that belief on the crumpled
state of his stocking, but on the
broad ground that no man can see
ghosts, and hear strange voices from
the other world, and see a dreadful
action forced on him of which he
doesn't know the result, and yet remain
as firm in his pulse, and collected
in his faculties, as a chairman
of Quarter Sessions, or an alderman
at a city feast."</p>

<p>"I fear, Miss Claribel, you form
such an estimate of an actor's requirements,
that you will never fulfil your
own expectations." I spoke with a
slight tone of displeasure.</p>

<p>"You are very severe," she replied;
"but I will fulfil my own expectations,
for they are not very high. I
will enter into Ophelia's feelings&mdash;they
shall enter into me; and I and
Ophelia shall be one and indivisible."</p>

<p>"Now, you are not afraid of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
'mannerism' you spoke of some days
ago?"</p>

<p>"It is the rock people who enter
into a character are apt to split on;
but I will endeavour to bear Juliet
and Desdemona, and Viola, all with
a difference."</p>

<p>"We shall see," I said, in no good
humour. "On Thursday we shall
go down to the Paragon Royal. My
mother will go and be spectatress of
the fight; and, come what may, I will
show the world a true reading of the
noble Dane." Miss Claribel smiled,
and so did my mother, exemplifying
the numerous meanings that can be
conveyed by that position of the lips.
Miss Claribel's was the more beautiful
mouth, but I liked the expression
of my mother's more.</p>

<p>I pass over the preparations, the
journey, the disappointment at the
sight of the ugly street and hideous
building in which our fortunes were
to be tried. At six I was dressed
and on the stage, Miss Claribel in her
dressing-room, my mother in a stage-box;
not a soul in the pit, nobody at
the door; two orange-women standing
beside their baskets near the
orchestra, and the whole house, as
seen by me through a hole in the
green curtain, deserted and uncomfortable
in the extreme. The manager,
a most polite little gentleman,
who was great in comedy, and enacted
the part of Osric, was at my side.
I pointed out the discouraging aspect
of the theatre. "O, you'll see in
half an hour," he said, "crowds filling
every seat. My Osric is a poor
part, but very popular."</p>

<p>Polonius joined us, an old man,
who at Christmas was a great
favourite as Pantaloon in the pantomime.</p>

<p>"It will be a great house, I feel
sure," he mumbled through his toothless
gums. "Old Jack Ivory as
Polonius is sure to draw." Not one
of them attributed the expected multitude
in any respect to the debutant in
Hamlet, or the beauty of the Ophelia.</p>

<p>"The worst thing I see about it is,
that the band with your friend, the
foreign gentleman, has not arrived,"
said Count Osric; "and if a Paragon
audience are disappointed, they always
throw ginger-beer bottles at the
manager's head. I wish we had
opened in Coriolanus: I should have
worn a helmet."</p>

<p>"I feel quite certain my friend, Mr
Catsbach, will not disappoint us," I
said; "and from the present appearance
of the boxes, pit, and gallery,
I think I may congratulate you on
the small number of bottles you will
have to sustain."</p>

<p>"Wait a little, I beg, my dear sir;
Osric has never failed me yet, and the
artisans and mechanics are not able
to appear here much before seven."</p>

<p>"The nobility and gentry?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"O, some of the garrison will
come in after mess, at half price, in
time to make bets on the fencing
scene."</p>

<p>"I am glad they take so deep an
interest," I began.</p>

<p>"Lor' bless ye! they very often
jump on the stage and take a turn with
Laertes themselves; and once a very
curious thing happened: Two of the
young officers gave ten shillings apiece
to the Hamlet to tire Laertes
down. Hamlet was an excellent
fencer. He wouldn't on any account
accept the button on any part of his
clothes&mdash;there was no palpable hit&mdash;the
whole house took a great interest
in the Shaksperian drama, and half-crowns
were posted in all parts of
the boxes on the bout. I was afraid
the buttons might come off the foils,
and made them exchange their rapiers
for single-stick. Laertes at last
planted a hit on Hamlet's nose, and
upwards of £20 changed hands on
the occasion. Hamlet drew every
night after that for three weeks, until
the colonel-commandant interfered,
and we were driven from the bard of
Avon to the "Miller and his Men."
There is no freedom for the legitimate
drama; but I hope to-night, sir, the
tragic muse will be reinstated on
these boards. I expect a great house,
for I have let it be pretty generally
known that you are a master of fence."</p>

<p>"If the worst comes to the worst,"
said Polonius, "and the fiddlers don't
make their appearance, I think old
Jack Ivory can always appease a
storm. Pray, sir, do you play on
any instrument?"</p>

<p>"The flute," I said, hesitatingly,
and with a look of inquiry what the
object of his question could be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"That makes it quite safe," replied
Polonius; "you shall accompany me
by way of an overture, for there ain't
a man in England gets more applause
in 'Hot Codlins' than myself."</p>

<p>I tried to laugh, as if I considered
the proposition an excellent joke; but
I have every reason to believe the
wretch was serious. I began to perceive
that every person engaged on
the stage, though only to deliver a
message, thinks himself the principal
performer; he also is of opinion that
there is no disparity of rank upon the
boards, but that what the clown does,
may also be done by the tragedian.
I have no doubt Diavolo Antonio
looked down on Edmund Kean. I
was on the point of renewing the
conversation, when an enormous noise
at the pit-entrance attracted my notice.
A thrill of gratification came
into my heart. All regard for Shakspeare
is not yet extinct, in spite of
fencing Hamlets and ignorant managers.
The rush into the pit was prodigious.
I looked through the green
curtain once more. Her Majesty's
ship, the Periander, 44, had been paid
off that morning, and the gallant
crew and their wives filled every
bench. The majority of the valiant
defenders of their country were polygamists
to the most undeniable amount,
and seemed rather proud of the extent
to which they broke the law.
Those who rejoiced in single blessedness
limited themselves to one wife.
The trebly blessed were numerous,
and the boatswain had six to share
his heart and fortunes. Here I perceived
the manager's perils, but not
from ginger-beer. There were cans
of gin and rum, that would have supplied
a tavern for a week. Single
bottles of whisky were brandished in
the air, as on festive occasions landsmen
wave their hats; and in a short
time the calls for music became overpowering,
and the manager sent secretly
for a company of marines and
a division of the police.</p>

<p>"If that hairy-cheeked foreigner
doesn't come," said Osric, with unaffected
fear, "there will be a row, like
the boarding of an enemy's ship.
They always think us foreigners when
we wear slashed doublets; and in the
war time they shipped off my predecessor,
who was acting a Parisian
marquis, in a cartel that was just
starting with a batch of French
prisoners to be exchanged. The
poor man died in the hulks at Toulon,
for he had been counted against
an English captain, and they kept
him in captivity because the captain
refused to return."</p>

<p>I looked at my watch: it only
wanted ten minutes to seven, and the
storm rising every moment. If Catsbach
plays me false, I shall rescue
my mother, I thought, and fight
my way into the street. I looked
at my sword; it was of silver-gilt
tin, and couldn't have committed
manslaughter on the body of Tom
Thumb. A universal cheer proclaimed
an arrival; and I declare the
first scrape of the fiddle was the
sweetest music I ever heard. It gave
quite a new turn to the behaviour of
the sailors. They ordered "God
save the Queen" and "Rule Britannia,"
and then roared lustily for
a hornpipe. Catsbach gratified them
in whatever they asked. At last
they called for a gangway to be
placed from the orchestra on to the
stage, and proposed commencing the
dramatic proceedings of the evening
by a miscellaneous country dance.
This, however, was not accorded&mdash;the
little bell rang&mdash;and the serious
overture began.</p>

<p>At this moment Mr Wormwood,
out of breath, and enraptured apparently
with my approaching triumph,
caught me by the hand. "Let me
introduce you," he said, "to the three
greatest critics in Europe. We have
hurried from London to see your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">debût</i>.
I have the highest opinion of your
genius, and feel sure you will be most
unanimously and ignominiously cat-called&mdash;as
<em>we</em> were."</p>

<p>The three gentlemen bowed, and
retired into the stage-box beside my
mother, to write a description of my
reception. I was too indignant to
speak, and suddenly the curtain rose,
and the play began. The ghost was
received with the most vociferous
applause, and seemed to strike the
naval mind as the liveliest personage
in the play. His silence was considered
a remarkably comic piece of
character, and evidently assumed to
cover his forgetfulness of the words.
Many exhortations were offered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
him to take another spell at the book,
or spin them a yarn out of his own
head. Allusions were also made to
his obesity, which evidently did not
accord with the forecastle's idea of a
ghost; and when, in spite of all the
advice and suggestion that had been
offered him, he maintained an imperturbable
silence, they got into a violent
state of indignation at having
been defrauded of the speeches; for
they could not believe it possible for
a personage to stalk across the stage
and look so very solemn without
having anything to say. Whereupon
Count Osric went forward and
soothed them by a solemn promise
that in some of the succeeding scenes
the ghost would be as talkative as
they chose. Satisfied with this, they
received the opening scene of the
court of Denmark with several rounds
of applause, which were duly responded
to by each of the performers on
the stage.</p>

<p>With a dignity befitting the crown-prince
of a gallant nation, I maintained
my position on the left of the
king, and made no recognition of the
welcome offered me in so tumultuous
a manner. I observed an orange
glide within a few inches of my face,
and splash on the back of the royal
chair; but affairs advanced so rapidly
from this point that I had no time to
take notice of the insult. When the
king had arrived at about the middle
of the first speech, a quarrel took
place in the pit between two captains
of the maintop, and a challenge was
rapidly exchanged. A sudden whistle
from the boatswain called attention
to the interesting fact, and the play
was suspended for a few minutes till
the belligerents gave and received
the satisfaction which their injured
honours required. While the two
captains were belabouring each other,
to the admiration of all the audience,
the manager slipt up to where I was
standing, and whispered, "I feel
greatly obliged for the five-pound
note, and also for the three guineas
you have left for the supper to-night;
but my advice to you is to slip off the
stage as fast as you can; convey the
lady who accompanied you to the
coach-office&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why?" I said. "This riot will
soon be over."</p>

<p>"A worse is coming; for a dreadful
disappointment has occurred. Do
as I advise you, or I won't answer
that we shan't all be ducked in the
river&mdash;lady, too, if she's found out
to belong to your party."</p>

<p>"And not a word of my part
yet spoken! Perhaps they will be
stilled when they hear the voice of
Hamlet."</p>

<p>"My dear sir, they've taken a disgust
to you already. If you spoke,
they would throw the benches at your
head. There! one of the men is
going to give in, and I must announce
that the play is changed for three
farces and some rope-dancing."</p>

<p>I saw the pit looking rather excited,
and Bill Hatches was declared
the winner. I was hurrying off the
stage to change my clothes. I was
stopt by Mr Wormwood and his
friends. "Your attitude, my dear
friend, offended them at once. It
was sublime. Princes should always
stand on tiptoe; it was above their
comprehension. They have stamped
you a great and original genius with
the seal of their unqualified disapprobation.
I congratulate you heartily,
and feel sure of your unanimous reception
in the brotherhood we have
established, called the Unappreciables&mdash;entrance
fee one guinea&mdash;and
undying hatred to successful mediocrity."</p>

<p>"I have no time for such offensive
absurdity," I said, and hurried away,
in imitation of the whole of the Danish
court, which had gone off to dress
for the rope-dancing and the farce.
I merely slipped my cloak over
the spangled grandeurs of Elsinore,
and was rushing towards the dressing-room
of the ladies, to warn Miss
Claribel, and place her along with
my mother in safety from the predicted
storm, when I heard Count
Osric, now dressed as a heavy father,
in a domestic drama of George I.'s
time, addressing the audience, which
was for a moment hushed in grim repose
to hear what he had to say.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he said,
"such a grievous calamity has befallen
this establishment, that it is
impossible on this occasion to proceed
with the play of Hamlet."</p>

<p>"Pipe all hands to quarters,"
shouted a voice at the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
pit; "prepare for boarding;" and
the obedient crew stood up, ready
to cast themselves over the side of
the pit, and carry the orchestra and
stage, bottle in hand.</p>

<p>"The fact is, that a serious mishap
has occurred to the representative
of the innocent and beautiful
Ophelia."</p>

<p>"'Vast with all that palaver,"
cried a hundred voices. "Why
don't you clap all sail on her, and
bring her into line?"</p>

<p>"She has this moment eloped with
one of the fiddlers," resumed the
manager, "and we throw ourselves
on your indulgence, to allow us to
withdraw the immortal Hamlet, and
offer you 'Hot Codlings,' by your old
friend Jack Ivory, in its place."</p>

<p>"Scoundrel!" I said, and seized
the manager by the neckcloth, as he
came behind the scenes after this
eloquent address. "What do you
mean by such ribald impertinence,
inventing such an infamous lie to save
your wretched theatre, and more
wretched carcass, at the expense of
Miss Claribel's reputation?"</p>

<p>"It's a perfect truth, sir; they're
off; the dirty foreigner led her out of
the theatre, and told me not to expect
them again. I'll hold him answerable
for all damage."</p>

<p>I contented myself with giving the
heavy father a hearty shake; sent
round for my mother to join me behind
the scenes; and amazed, bewildered,
horror-struck, and sick at heart, conducted
her to the coach-office, leaving
the manager to sustain the assaults of
his exasperated audience as he best
could.</p>

<p>"Miss Claribel has deceived us,"
said my mother.</p>

<p>"Not me," I said bitterly, "I
suspected her to be no better than she
should be, from the strange notions of
acting she entertained. Besides, Catsbach
warned me of her from the beginning;
and betted he would prove
her to be an impostor and hypocrite.
He has won his bet."</p>

<p>"I can't believe it yet," replied my
mother; "but time will show."</p>

<p>"If Catsbach ever comes into my
presence," I said, "I will horsewhip
him like a hound."</p>

<p>"My dear," said my mother, "I
am afraid you admire Miss Claribel
too much yourself."</p>

<p>"Psha!" I replied, "I hate her,
and Catsbach more; and if I ever see
them, I will tell them so."</p>


<h4>CHAPTER XIII.</h4>

<p>I saw them often and often after
that, but never told him anything of
the sort. On waking next morning,
I saw the bugled satins and silver-buckled
shoes of the Prince of Denmark,
in which I had performed my
hurried retreat to London, lying near
my bed. They were like basilisks,
and offended my eyes, though they
did not altogether strike me dead.
Disappointed in my hopes of theatric
glory, I held a calm consultation with
myself on the state of affairs. It
took several days to come to a final
resolve, for there were many counsellors
who interested themselves in
the question, and held fierce debates
on every point laid before them.
Above all, there was the Hope of
nineteen, and the Vanity of a spoilt
child. How warmly they argued the
matter against the cold objections of
common sense and experience, I need
not tell. Most people have gone
through the dreadful process of awakening
to the knowledge of their own
inferiority. The pertinacity of that
spirit of self-inquiry, that strips off a
man's delusions one by one, "till
fold after fold to the piercing air," his
mediocrity, dulness, and insufficiency
are all laid open, brings with it, at
one time or other of our existence, a
wholesome lesson that alters our
whole being. There are probably
not two neighbourhoods in England
that do not boast of embryo Shakspeares
and future Lord Chancellors&mdash;clever,
flippant, superficial young
fellows, who, relying on the real abilities
which they possess, and comparing
themselves only with the sober
old curate, the uncultivated surgeon,
the turnip-growing squire, and a bevy
of old maids and dowagers, believe
that, when the world is opened to their
ambition, they will retain the same
superiority in that wider field which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
they have undoubtedly achieved at
home. Their aspirations being greater
than their powers, they gain fresh
food for their self-conceit, from the
failures of other men; and, comparing
what they fancy they can do with
what they see actually done by others,
they look down with ill-disguised contempt
on authors whom they can only
half understand, and betake themselves
to criticism before they have
learned to write. The more foolish of
them, and the vainest, persist in their
fancied superiority, or attempt to drag
down others to the miserable level to
which they feel they have sunk themselves.
The wiser and honester shake
off these sable stains, measure their
stature with that of the great and
good, and give up the race before
they have either become broken-winded
or are made a laughing-stock
to the spectators. I took a pair of
scissors and deliberately reduced the
small-clothes of Hamlet into shreds.
I removed the buckles from His Royal
Highness's shoes, and used them as
comfortable slippers. But I did more:
With self-devoting hands, I laid Hengist
and Horsa on the fire; saw the
noble speeches of heroes and heroines
ascend the chimney in smoke, and sat
and watched the shrivelled-up paper
as it alternately glowed and blackened
on the top of the coals. It was delightful;
and I felt happier than if I
were bowing from a private box,
amidst the unanimous acclamations
of the Stepney Star.</p>

<p>A week had elapsed since the display
at the Paragon Royal. I started
up all of a sudden, rushed up stairs,
dressed as if for an evening party,
took my flute in my pocket, and was
going out of the house.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" said
my mother, alarmed at the excessive
energy of my proceedings.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you when I come back,"
I said. "I am going to look out for
honest occupation." A cab hurried
me rapidly to Muswell Hill. We entered
a handsome gateway. Mr Pybus
was at home, and I was ushered into
the drawing-room. There was nobody
in the room when I entered. Two
candles were burning on the mantel-piece,
and left the other portions of
the magnificently furnished and large
apartment completely in shade. I
had announced myself merely as a
gentleman who wished to see Mr
Pybus. I had hoped for a private
interview, in which to explain to him,
if possible, the reasons of my past
conduct, and ask him to accept me as
a clerk in his counting-house. My
pride was broken at last, and I never
entertained either a thought or a wish
that he would renew his offer of sending
me to the university. I determined
even to accommodate myself
so entirely to my altered prospects, as
to undertake the office of music-master
to his daughter. I was immersed in
these meditations, when I was suddenly
conscious of a presence at my
side. It was Emily, who had slipt in
over the luxurious carpet, without her
footfall being heard.</p>

<p>"I expected you last week," she
said, without the least apparent surprise
at my altered appearance; for I
had discarded, of course, the false
beard and mustaches that preserved
my incognito in Grosvenor Square.
"You are faithless to your engagement
with papa; but I felt sure you would
come."</p>

<p>"At one time I had determined
never to present myself at your house;
but late events have opened my eyes
to the folly of my conduct. I am
come to thank your father for his
great kindness."</p>

<p>"Not at all: it's all my doing and
mamma's; and now we take a greater
interest in you than ever. It was
a dreadful business that murder of
poor Hamlet at the Paragon."</p>

<p>"You amaze me!" I began. "How
have you possibly heard of that ridiculous
catastrophe?"</p>

<p>"O! we know all about it&mdash;and
about the Hengist and Horsa, and the
Stepney Star. Some bill, or other extravagance
of yours, has come into
papa's hands in the way of business,
and he has paid the full value of it to
Mr Montalban. So he laughs, and
says he is your creditor now; and if
you don't give good lessons, he will
put you in prison."</p>

<p>"I wasn't aware that my proceedings
were of so much importance," I
said, "as to have required such a
number of spies to find them out." I
suppose I frowned.</p>

<p>"You needn't be angry again," she
replied. "You will be soon beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
to remember that your name is De
Bohun."</p>

<p>"That, at all events," I said, with
a lingering feeling of pride, "is a satisfaction
of which it is impossible to
deprive me."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that," replied
Emily, with a gay and slightly sarcastic
laugh. "We may have as
many dramatic surprises here as in a
tragedy. But, in the mean time, till
papa comes up from the dining-room,
do accompany me on the flute."</p>

<p>She flew rather than walked, towards
the piano, seated herself in a
moment, and dashed into a florid
piece of music, which it required all
my skill on the instrument to keep up
with. "Bravo!&mdash;bravo!" she said,
at intervals; "you play beautifully.
This is better than Hamlet. What
would Fitz-Edward say&mdash;or Miss de
la Rose?"</p>

<p>I stopt. "Will you save me from
insanity," I said, "or prevent me
from thinking you a witch, by telling
me how you know all those horrid
names?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'm a clairvoyante&mdash;perhaps
you are magnetised; but go on&mdash;I
can't lose the concert."</p>

<p>So we played&mdash;turned over page
after page&mdash;tried overtures, and
operas, and dances&mdash;and took no
note of anything, except what we
were engaged on. Suddenly I was
aware that we were no longer in the
dark&mdash;the room was comfortably
lighted. We were also no longer
alone. While absorbed in our music,
several persons had entered the room,
and were standing behind our chairs
in deep attention.</p>

<p>"Capital!&mdash;capital!" cried a well-known
voice, laying a hand roughly
on my shoulder; "better a hundred
times than your attempts on Shakspeare,
or your triumphs at the Paragon
Royal."</p>

<p>I looked round, and saw my friend
Catsbach, or rather Mr Tooks, for he
was shorn of his foreign ornaments,
and was an honest, plain-faced, handsome
English gentleman.</p>

<p>"You don't know Mrs Tooks," he
continued. "Ellinor, my love, give
your hand to Mr de Bohun."</p>

<p>Miss Claribel stood before me, radiant
with beauty, and leaning on Mr
Tooks's arm.</p>

<p>"You are his Ellinor?" I stammered,
endeavouring to recall the
story of Catsbach's woes. "You left
him at the door of the church&mdash;he
advertised for you in vain&mdash;went in
search of you to a boarding-school at
Guildford&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And found her, my boy, in the
act of going on the stage as Ophelia&mdash;wrote
a penitent letter to this good
lady, her aunt, Mrs Pybus&mdash;was accepted
as a returned prodigal&mdash;and
here I introduce you to our family
circle:&mdash;my uncle, Mr Pybus&mdash;my
cousin, Emily&mdash;my grandaunt, or
grandmother, I forget which, Mrs
Bone, from Bath; for she is my relation
through my wife. And, now that we
are all at home, we had better consult
what is best to be done." We did consult,
and the result was satisfactory.
I declined the army&mdash;I declined the
university&mdash;I accepted the chair in
Mr Pybus's office, vacated by my
friend Tooks. I was to continue
my accompaniments in music, and
my lessons in Latin and mathematics
every Saturday, and determined to
begin on the very next morning.</p>

<p>The whole party were delighted,
especially the old woman from Bath,
who, after a minute inquiry into my
father's Christian name&mdash;the curacy
he held&mdash;the name of his father, and
dates of births and marriages&mdash;fell on
my neck in the midst of supper, and
claimed me for a second or third
cousin. Oh! the agony of this last
blow! What! part with my connection,
through twenty descents, with
the Norman knights&mdash;the English
nobles&mdash;the heroes, warriors, statesmen&mdash;who
illustrated our family
tree!</p>

<p>"I never had any relations of the
name of De Bohun," said the old lady;
"but I remember my husband's uncle,
which was George Bone, which was
senior partner in the firm, Bones,
Brothers, in Milsom Street, the dentists,
took lofty notions into his head,
and sold his share of the business.
He brought up his children with very
fine ideas, and was always engaged
making out pedigrees proving he was
somebody else. So his son went the
same way, and called himself De Bohun,
and never took any notice of his
cousins, Philip and Sampson, which
carried on the business&mdash;which Ellinor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
is daughter of Sampson, who
died when she was a baby. And at
last this Mr De Bohun, as he called
himself, he sent his son to Oxford,
and a fine gentleman he was, and believed
all the rubbishy old names
that his father and grandfather had
written out on parchment, and married
the sister of that good Colonel
Bawls, which he looked down on, we
used to hear, because she wasn't a De
Bohun; and so, my dear young man,
you see you are a near relation of Ellinor
and me, and we are truly happy
to make your acquaintance."</p>

<p>I am afraid I did not respond so
warmly as was expected to this family
recognition. Emily touched me on
the shoulder&mdash;"Never mind," she
said, "whether your name be De Bohun
or not. Behave as if it were De
Mowbray. It will make no difference
to any of us here."</p>

<p>A day or two reconciled me to my
fate, especially as Saturday came very
rapidly round, and sometimes forced
itself into the middle of the week. I
devoted myself to my new pursuits&mdash;was
as attentive a clerk as if I had
never heard the name of a theatre&mdash;rose
gradually to a confidential post
in the counting-house&mdash;and saw the
origin of the interest taken in me by
Mr Pybus. He was agent for my
uncle, the general, and had instructions
and authority from him to advance
whatever might be required for
the comfort of my mother or my advancement
in life. I need not tell
how kindly I was treated by the
Indian warrior when he came home
on a special mission to the Government&mdash;how
I refused his offer to accompany
him back to the scene of his
command&mdash;and how he winked and
poked me in a facetious manner in the
ribs as he perceived the cause of my
wishing to remain in England. Modesty
had now taken possession of me
in place of the vaulting ambition which
had so often made me fall on the other
side. I never ventured to put into
words the sentiments that filled my
heart with regard to Emily Pybus.
A clerk in her father's office&mdash;a dependant
on my uncle's bounty&mdash;a
rejected author&mdash;a broken-down stage-player&mdash;I
considered myself too far
below her in position to aspire so
high.</p>

<p>But time rolled on&mdash;the Saturdays
came round with unfailing regularity;
and when I was twenty-three, my
kind old uncle, who had distinguished
himself greatly by some prodigious increase
of the Company's revenue, and
probably his own, wrote me a letter to
say he entirely approved of my conduct&mdash;that
he had accepted a baronetcy,
and got a clause inserted in
the patent insuring the reversion of
the title to me;&mdash;and, in short, about
three months ago, we sent round to
our friends a couple of nice little calling-cards,
tied together with a silver
thread, on which was printed Mr and
Mrs Charles Bone, Wilton Place,
Belgravia.</p>

<p>In the year 1841, a young Englishman,
without fortune, friends, or
prospects in his own country, not
unwisely resolved to seek all three in
a land where the race of life is run
upon a less crowded course than in
thickly-peopled Britain. He embarked
for the antipodes. His ship must
have sailed on a Friday&mdash;unless,
indeed, we may attribute the mishaps
and disasters she encountered to a
deficient outfit and an incompetent
captain. Compelled to put into
Portsmouth to amend bad stowage,
she next cast anchor&mdash;after being
buffeted by storms, wearisomely becalmed,
and visited by the small-pox&mdash;in
a Brazilian port, there to take
in live-stock and fresh provisions.
Once more at sea, it was soon discovered
that these&mdash;for whose reception
three weeks had been idled away
at Bahia&mdash;would scarcely last three
weeks longer. So a pause must be
made at the Cape. The ship was a
tub, the captain a bungler, the lighthouse
(since removed) was invisible
where most needed. The vessel
struck on the rocks of Table Bay,
upon which, all night long, the
breakers furiously hurled her to and
fro. The darkness was profound, the
ship full of water, rescue seemed
hopeless, the boom of the signal-guns
was drowned by the roar of the
storm. At last succour came. Five
gallant fellows perished in bringing
it, but perished not in vain. Crew
and passengers were taken off the
wreck. Life was saved, but goods
were lost. After five tedious months,
which, with ordinary skill and foresight,
should have brought the young
emigrant to his final destination, he
found himself stranded at the Cape,
instead of landed at New Zealand;
his clothes, money, letters&mdash;all he
possessed, in short&mdash;buried, fathoms
deep, beneath the stormy billows of
the South Atlantic.</p>

<p>To this calamity are we indebted
for the spirited volume before us.
The proverb about "an ill wind"
exactly fits the occasion. After a
while a ship was chartered for those
who chose to proceed to New Zealand.
Mr Cole was not of the number. He
had conceived a liking for the Cape
Colony, and proposed remaining
there. He did so for five years, with
what amount of profit we are not
informed, but evidently passing his
time pleasantly, and departing with
regret. He made himself well acquainted
with Cape life in most of its
phases, and amongst all classes;
and he has cleverly transferred to
paper the vivid impressions he
received.</p>

<p>How Mr Cole occupied himself
during his residence at the Cape does
not appear from his narrative. His
active disposition, as well as his own
statement of his slender means,
forbids the supposition of rambling
for mere amusement's sake.
Whatever his employment, he travelled
much, and visited most parts
of the colony, preferring the rural
districts to the towns. The first
glimpse he gives of South African
scenery is pleasing enough. With a
fellow-passenger he drives out to
Rondesbosch, "the Richmond of Cape
Town," a pleasant cluster of handsome
houses, with large gardens.
Thence, along an excellent road, to
Wynberg, another agreeable village.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Beyond Wynberg the road loses its
trim, pretty, artificial appearance, and
becomes more African and barren. No,
not barren either; for who could apply
such a term to land covered with an
innumerable variety of Cape heaths in
full bloom?&mdash;aloes, wild stocks, and a
thousand other delicate and lovely plants,
making a natural carpet, more beautiful
than all the corn-fields and gardens of
civilisation. This road leads to Constantia,
famed for the delicious wine to
which it gives its name."</p></blockquote>

<p>A history of celebrated vineyards
would be a work attractive alike to
the antiquarian and to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon vivant</i>.
Strange that it has never been
written, considering how many it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
would interest. Its author would not
fail to note the peculiarity of certain
small spots of ground, differing to all
appearance in no way from hundreds
of thousands of neighbouring acres,
save in the quality of their grape
juice. Near at hand, the Rhine
ascending, St John's Mount furnishes
an example. Far south of the line,
thousands of leagues removed, Constantia's
hill repeats the marvel.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There are but three farms, situated
on the side of a hill, where the grape
producing this beautiful wine grows. It
has been tried, but without success, in
various other parts of the colony. Even
a mile from the hill, the wine is of a very
inferior description. The hill is named
after the wife of one of the former governors
of the Cape&mdash;whether from the lady's
too great fondness for its productions,
history sayeth not. The Constantia
wine-farmers are rich men, and have
elegant and well-furnished houses, surrounded
by gardens and their vineyards.
The names of the three farms and their
proprietors are&mdash;High Constantia, Van
Reenen; Great Constantia, Cloete;
Little Constantia, Coligne. A visit to
them is a treat."</p></blockquote>

<p>So thought Jones, a thirsty Cockney,
who shared the buggy with Mr Cole.
The "pikeman" grinned as they paid
the toll and inquired the way to the
renowned vineyards. "He hoped,"
he said, "they'd look as well when
they comed back." A demand for an
explanation was met by the deprecatory
reply, "that he meant no offence,
but had see'd many look very different
arter swallowing the sweet stuff
up there&mdash;that's all." Whereupon
Jones, indignant, savagely whipped
the hired nag, and they soon reached
Great Constantia.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We visited the vineyards, which are
kept beautifully neat and trim; and we
then went to the storehouses, which are
models of cleanliness. Here we tasted a
dozen varieties of the delicious wine;
and I began to have an exact idea of the
pikeman's observation. Nothing can be
more seductively delicious than the purest
and best Constantia. I may remark,
however, that I have never tasted a perfect
specimen of it in England. The
greater quantity of so-called Constantia,
sold in London, is sweet Pontac, a very
inferior wine, grown all over the Cape
colony&mdash;at least, wherever there are wine
farms.</p>

<p>"We afterwards visited the other two
farms, and found everything equally
handsome, liberal, clean, and well-ordered;
and we tasted all the varieties of
each of these also. I now began to have
a <em>very</em> clear idea of the pikeman's
meaning."</p></blockquote>

<p>So did Jones, perhaps, when, with
fishy eyes and uncertain gait, he
climbed the buggy, assumed the reins,
and drove homewards, shaving every
gate he passed through and corner
that he turned. At a certain distance
from the vineyard he informed his
companion that the sweet wine was
"stunning," and, having expressed
that opinion, astounded him by the
announcement that he had ordered
three butts of the best to be sent to
his (Cole's) lodgings, which consisted
of two very minute rooms. Besides
the difficulty of stowing so large a
store of liquor, Mr Cole made no
doubt it would be booked to him, and
was equally certain he should have to
pay for it, Jones being a shipwrecked
passenger, and copperless Cockney,
already in his debt. His first impulse
was to pitch Jones out of the gig;
his second, to countermarch and
countermand. But Jones, positively
refusing to return, drove valiantly
onwards.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"After driving for about an hour along
what seemed to me a very circuitous
route, we were approaching the entrance
to some grounds, very like those we had
quitted. On coming still nearer, Jones
remarked that 'he did not recollect passing
this d&mdash;&mdash;d place before.' I did. So
I suggested that I would just run in and
ask the way. I left him for a minute,
and returned with full instructions as to
our route, and with much persuasion
managed to keep my friend to the right
road to Cape Town. I had no fears
about the wine now, for we had returned
to Constantia, and I had countermanded
the order. Jones knew nothing about it
next day."</p></blockquote>

<p>Much valued by the wine-merchant,
Cape wines, as a class, and with the
single exception of Constantia, are
odious to the English consumer.
Theirs is the dog's misfortune;&mdash;they
have a bad name, which the growers
do their best to keep up by sending
to the mother-country the worst product
of their vines. Mr Cole frequently
pointed out to them the bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
policy of this. The answer he got was,
that Cape wine is in such disesteem
that it is bought in England without
distinction of vintage or class, the
worst fetching as good a price as the
best. Yet, according to Mr Cole,
there is a vast difference in the qualities;
and even the best are susceptible
of great improvement, if properly
managed. On the subject of wine-growing
at the Cape, he makes some
shrewd observations, which, if ever
the unlucky colony is restored to
tranquillity and delivered from dread
of Kafirs, may be well worth the
consideration of speculators conversant
with that class of cultivation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is a great similarity between the
Cape and the Madeira grape. Both are
cultivated much in the same manner, and
in both the natural acidity is great; but
the grand point of difference between the
two is in the time of gathering the
grapes. In Madeira they are not gathered
till so ripe that many begin to fall, and
are withered from over-ripeness: these,
of course, are rejected. By this means
a smaller amount of wine is obtained
from a vineyard than would have been
produced had the grapes been gathered
earlier; but the quality of the wine is
improved beyond conception. Every
grape is full, ripe, and luscious, and the
wine partakes of its quality. Nothing
can prove more clearly the necessity of
the grape being fully, and even <em>over</em> ripe,
than the difference of the wine produced
on the north side of the island of Madeira,
where this perfection of the grape can
scarcely be attained, and that grown on
the south side: the latter is luscious and
rich; the former is Cape, or little better.
Now, at the Cape, the object of the farmer
always is to get the greatest <em>quantity</em> of
wine from his vineyard; and consequently
he gathers his grapes when they
are barely ripe, and none have fallen or
withered; whereby he fills his storehouses
with wine full of that acidity and
vile twang which all who have tasted
shudder to recall. Some of the wine-growers
in the colony have lately pursued
a different course, and with vast
success."</p></blockquote>

<p>English colonists these, not Dutch,
for the boers are wedded to old systems.
Had the first settlers at the
Cape been Frenchmen from Rheims
and Bordeaux, instead of Dutchmen
unused to more generous drink than
swipes and Geneva, the vintage of
South Africa might now be renowned
instead of despised. One of Mr Cole's
fellow-passengers was a Frenchman,
from Champagne, a smart, active fellow,
who had followed all sorts of
occupations, from teaching French
to commanding a privateer. Shipwrecked
and penniless, but far from
dejected, he prevailed on a companion
in misfortune, an Englishman,
who had means, to take a
wine-farm, and him for a partner.
The Cape champagne they made was
excellent, and often since, Mr Cole
pathetically declares, when swallowing
extract of gooseberries at a public
or private dinner-table, in England, he
has sighed for a bottle of their vintage.
He sums up the subject as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"From observation and experience, I
am inclined to think that a company
might be profitably established, here or
at the Cape, for cultivating the vine in
the colony, and importing its produce to
Europe; but they must send out their
own labourers and superintendents, carefully
selected from the best vineyards in
Germany or France; take care to adopt
the Madeira plan of gathering the grapes;
agitate for a reduction of the duty on the
wine, which is too high; and do all they
can to get rid of their greatest obstacle&mdash;a
bad name in the market."</p></blockquote>

<p>Disguised as sherry or Madeira,
who can tell how much Cape he annually
swallows? Port wine, too, is
adulterated with a red Cape called
Pontac. Were the cultivation of the
African wines improved, and the best
qualities imported, there is no reason
why we should despise, in its neat
dress, that which we have so often
accepted under Spanish or Portuguese
colours. And certainly it would be
more satisfactory to drink the produce
of a British colony than that of countries
who show so little disposition to
reciprocate the liberality of our tariffs,
and our immense consumption of articles
of their growth. Nor is the
vine the only plant which, with proper
care and encouragement, might,
in Mr Cole's opinion, and with every
appearance of probability, be raised
at the Cape, to an extent that would
greatly diminish the necessity we are
now under of purchasing from the
thankless foreigner.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the very spot where the village
of Somerset now stands, <small>TOBACCO</small> was
first raised in the colony, under the care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
of a Dr Makrill. Like almost everything
else, it grew and flourished admirably in
a Cape soil, and is now raised in considerable
quantities in various parts of the
colony. It is called Boer's tobacco, to
distinguish it from the various species of
the imported weed. Here, again, the
want of proper energy, so constantly observable
in the colonists, whether Dutch
or English, is displayed. Every man
smokes&mdash;and immense numbers also chew&mdash;tobacco.
The Hottentots of both sexes
take heaps of snuff&mdash;not, by the way, up
their nostrils, but in their mouths!&mdash;and
yet tobacco has to be imported to a considerable
extent into a country which
might not only grow enough for its own
wants, but sufficient to supply half the
world besides. Every one admits the
fact; but the answer is, 'Want of labour,'
that eternal complaint of South Africa.
There is much truth in it; but there is a
considerable 'want of energy' also."</p></blockquote>

<p>There is no manifest reason why,
with care and good cultivation, we
should not grow cigars at the Cape,
such as might successfully vie&mdash;if not
with the <em>regalias</em> of the Havannah&mdash;at
least with the indigenous cabbage,
and with the coarser Cuban and
South American weed. If an ardent
sun be one essential for obtaining a
fine description of tobacco&mdash;and we
are led to suppose so by considering
the latitudes whence the best sorts
come, and the inferiority of those
grown in Europe&mdash;there is no want
of it in certain districts of Cape Colony.
At Fort Beaufort the heat is
so terrible that the sentries' buttons
are said to melt and drop off. But it
is a delightful peculiarity of the Cape
climate, that, even in these desperately
hot places, it is always healthy.
As regards the "want of labour,"
alleged by the colonists as an excuse
for neglecting many valuable sources
of profit, it is only to be repaired by
encouraging a steady stream of emigration
from the mother country to
the Cape. The general and most
important impression left upon the
reader's mind by Mr Cole's book&mdash;which,
although light and often playful
in style, contains valuable information,
and is the book of a sensible
man&mdash;is, that, with its fertile
soil and beautiful climate, it ought to
become a most prosperous and flourishing
country. Immigration and
good government are all it wants.
Of course, neither of these has it any
chance of obtaining so long as Lord
Grey rules its destinies; but we may
venture to hope that he will not do
so long. The Cape, Mr Cole justly
observes, has never been a "pet"
colony with our Colonial administration.
Incompetent governors, threats
of convict importations, and Kafir
wars, have rendered it unpopular with
every class of emigrants. And, doubtless,
they have all, more or less, contributed
to the apathetic indolence
and discouragement which, as we
gather from Mr Cole's volume, is to
be noted in most of the colonists.
With the Dutch, apathy may be in
some degree constitutional; but it is
not natural to Englishmen; nor is it
to be explained by any enervating or
sickly properties of the climate. As
to the sheep-farmer, he is the very
incarnation of laziness.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He turns out of bed about eleven,
huddles on a pair of trousers, with the
shirt he slept in; thrusts his feet into a
pair of shoes, pulls a wide-awake hat over
his head, and his toilet is complete. He
then sticks a short pipe into his mouth,
loiters about the homestead, and talks to
Hottentots not <em>more</em> lazy than himself,
from the simple reason that <em>that</em> were
impossible; takes a cup of coffee, and
perhaps a chop; smokes and dozes away
the whole day; looks at the sheep as they
come home in the evening; 'slangs' the
herds, eats mutton again, and calls it
'dinner;' smokes again, and drinks
'<em>smoke</em>,' (Cape Smoke is a sort of brandy;)
pulls off his shoes, hat, and nether garments,
and turns in again, to snooze till
eleven the next day, and then gets up,
and goes through the same process once
more."</p></blockquote>

<p>When the white man sets such example,
what can be expected from the
black? The Hottentots are the general
servants of the colony, both farm
and domestic, at least in all the eastern
districts. Shocking bad ones they
are, but yet they get good wages,
abundant food, and are engaged without
being asked for a character, which
indeed were superfluous trouble, one
very bad one fitting them all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A Hottentot," says Mr Cole, "is the
most improvident, lazy animal on the face
of the earth. He will work for a month,
and, as soon as he has pocketed his wages,
leave his master, and be drunk whilst he
has a solitary sixpence left. He is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
living paradox; a drunkard, and a thief,
and yet one that can practise abstinence,
and never rob his master. Sometimes
you may trust him with anything of any
value, whilst in your service, and he will
not pick and steal. After he has left
you, he will as soon appropriate your
Wellingtons (if he calls to see his successor
in office) as wear his own shoes.
He is the dirtiest fellow on earth, and
will clean neither your rooms, your boots,
nor your knives and forks, unless you are
eternally driving him to his work; yet
he will wash his hands with the utmost
care before he touches the food he is
preparing for your dinner, though he has
the greatest natural antipathy to the
contact of cold water."</p></blockquote>

<p>These Hottentots have an ugly habit
of leaving their master in a body,
without apparent cause, or previous
notice. It is their way of taking a
holiday. They are sure to find employment,
when willing again to work;
the demand, even for such labour as
theirs, being much greater than the
supply. As yet civilisation has done
little for them. As to the result of
missionary efforts, Mr Cole estimates
it as exceedingly small. There is considerable
discrepancy between his
statements on this head and the glowing
reports occasionally issued by missionary
societies, of their successful labours
amongst the heathens of Africa.
Briefly, but forcibly, Mr Cole shows
up the humbug and delusion of the
system. From personal experience
he declares himself convinced that, out
of every hundred Hottentot Christians,
(so styled,) ninety-nine have no notion
of a future state.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have frequently been at the bedside
of the sick and dying Hottentot, who has
been a constant attendant at some missionary
chapel, and I have asked him
whether he has any fear of dying? He
has smiled, and said,</p>

<p>"'None.'</p>

<p>"I have asked him whether he expected
to go to heaven? and he has answered,</p>

<p>"'No.'</p>

<p>"'Where then?'</p>

<p>"'Nowhere.'</p>

<p>"I have endeavoured to explain to him
that his minister must have taught him
the doctrine of a future state of rewards
and punishments. He has laughed and
said, that perhaps it might be so, 'for the
master, but not for him; he lies down
and dies, that is all&mdash;that is enough.'
This I have heard over and over again
from the lips of some of the 'pet' Christians
of missionaries&mdash;model men, whom
they talk of and point out to every
'griffin' in the colony, and write long
communications about, to their societies
in England."</p></blockquote>

<p>Professing Christians abound amongst
the Hottentots, for the sake of the
temporal advantages. Every missionary
station has a tract of land
belonging to it, on which the Hottentot
who attends school and chapel
regularly, and assumes a becoming
appearance of piety, is permitted to
build a hut, and plant a garden. Seeds
and tools are given to him; and, with
very little labour, he is enabled to pass
the rest of his time in idleness.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is notorious," says Mr Cole, "that
these people, living at the missionary
stations, are the idlest and most useless
set in the colony. You cannot frighten
a farmer more seriously than by telling
him that a missionary station is going to
be established near him. Visions of daily
desertion by his servants float across his
mind's eye."</p></blockquote>

<p>But if the Hottentot be a bad servant,
and if, notwithstanding the
well-meant but misdirected efforts of
missionaries, whose zeal might find
better employment at home, he still
continues an idle, besotted, and filthy
savage, there yet is to be found, in
his immediate vicinity, a still more
degraded and untractable race. These
are the Boschjesmen, or Bushmen, of
whom specimens have been exhibited
in England. In their own land they
live in a state of barbarism, without
clothes, often without huts, growing
no corn or vegetables, and subsisting
upon such animals as they can kill
with their arrows&mdash;also upon locusts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the year 1844 or 1845, a traveller
in their country came upon whole kraals,
(or villages,) which appeared at first to
be deserted; but he found, on searching,
that 'most of the inhabitants were still
there&mdash;dead! There were great quantities
of dead locusts in their huts, and
the supposition was, that they had died
from eating them, either from some poison
contained in them, or from a surfeit."</p></blockquote>

<p>They are fierce and cruel, and as
mischievous as monkeys, to which
they bear a strong resemblance. On
the first journey that he made in a
waggon, Mr Cole had as "leader"&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
name given to the boy who leads
the two front oxen of the span&mdash;a
Bushman lad, about four feet high,
the most hideous monster, according
to the description given of him, that
ever walked on two legs. The expression
of his countenance was diabolical,
his disposition equally so.
The lash was the only argument he
understood; and even to that, owing
to the extraordinary toughness of his
hide, he was long callous.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On one occasion the waggon came to
the brow of a hill, when it was the leader's
duty to stop the oxen, and see that
the wheel was well locked. It may
readily be imagined that a waggon which
requires twelve oxen to draw it on level
ground, could not be held back at all by
<em>two</em> oxen, in its descent of a steep hill,
unless with the wheel locked. My interesting
Bushman, however, whom I had
not yet offended in any manner, no sooner
found himself at the top of the hill,
than he let go the oxen with a yell and a
whoop, which set them off at a gallop
down the precipitous steep. The waggon
flew from side to side of the road, destined,
apparently, to be smashed to atoms
every moment, together with myself, its
luckless occupant. I was dashed about,
almost unconscious of what could be the
cause, so suddenly had we started on our
mad career. Heaven only knows how I
escaped destruction, but we positively
reached the bottom of the hill uninjured.</p>

<p>"The Bushman was by the waggon-side
in an instant, and went to his place
at the oxen's head as coolly and unconcernedly
as if he had just performed part
of his ordinary duties. The Hottentot
driver, on the contrary, came panting up,
aghast with horror. I jumped out of
the waggon, seized my young savage by
the collar of his jacket, and, with a heavy
sea-cow-hide whip, I belaboured him
with all my strength, wherein, I trust
the reader will think me justified, as the
little wretch had made the most barefaced
attempt on my life. I almost
thought my strength would be exhausted
before I could get a sign from the young
gentleman that he felt my blows; but at
length he uttered a yell of pain, and I
knew he had had enough. Next day I
dropped him at a village, and declined
his farther services."</p></blockquote>

<p>Waggon-travelling in the Cape
Colony is a slow, but not a disagreeable,
manner of locomotion. The
same team of oxen takes you through,
however great the distance; and as
grass and water are all they get&mdash;and
sometimes a scanty ration of
these&mdash;the pace is necessarily very
moderate, twenty miles a-day being
considered good going. Of course
you have abundant stores in your waggon;
for inns are scarce, and it is not
usual to quarter yourself on the farmers,
as you do when travelling on horseback.
A stretcher, with a mattress
on it, is slung in the waggon, to lounge
on by day and sleep on by night; or
if the party be numerous, a tent is
pitched at evening. The Hottentots
sleep under the waggon or round the
fire. The start is at six in the morning.
At ten a two hours' halt is
made, to eat and smoke, to sketch or
shoot. At noon, the cattle, which
have been turned out to graze, are
"in-spanned," and the march continues
till three or four o'clock. Then
another halt and another meal; a
pipe, a shot at an ostrich or bushbuck;
and then once more on the
road for two hours, before "out-spanning"
for the night. The bivouac is
delightful; the sky of a deep dark
blue, the moon radiant, the magnificent
Southern Cross glittering in the
heavens, underfoot a carpet of scented
and variegated blossoms, stillness over
all, and in the dark shadow of the
bush a bright fire, with the wayfarers
stretched lazily around it. The whole
thing is a pleasant sort of picnic party,
and it is easy to believe Mr Cole
when he declares that he never enjoyed
a European trip so much as
waggon-travelling in South Africa.
Of course this is the sunny side of the
picture. Disagreeable occurrences
are by no means unfrequent. A
bridgeless rivulet, swollen to a torrent
by recent rains, detains you for
a week upon its banks, on half rations
or less. Your Hottentots discover
a hedge tavern, and whilst you
take a stroll with your gun during
the "out-span," they get helplessly
drunk, and you must halt for the day.
You thrash them and stop their
tobacco; they revenge themselves by
accidentally upsetting you in the next
river you cross; or they neglect to
watch the grazing oxen, which are
next heard of ten miles off, having
been "pounded" by some surly
landholder, with whose green corn
they had taken a liberty. The traveller
who dreads such mishaps and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
desires faster progress, packs a valise,
straps it on his saddle, and throws his
leg over a sturdy Cape horse, which
will carry him fifty or sixty miles a
day without flinching. Here is Mr
Cole's sketch of these useful, ill-looking
animals:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Generally speaking, a regular Cape
horse, one whose pedigree cannot be
traced to any imported stallion, is an ugly
brute. He is about fourteen hands high,
and his chief characteristics are, a low
narrow shoulder, a ewe neck, and a goose
rump. His 'pins' are generally pretty
good. He is villanously broken; his
mouth is as tough as an oak; his pace is
a shuffling, tripping, wriggling abomination,
between an amble and a canter, with
a suspicion of a 'run' in it. Put him
beyond this pace, and he gallops as
awkwardly as a cow. As for walking,
he is innocent of the pace beyond three
miles an hour. Trotting, neither he, nor
his breaker, nor breeder, nor owner (if a
Dutchman) ever heard of. He is apt to
be ill-tempered too&mdash;often given to kicking,
and occasionally to 'bucking.' So
much for his evil qualities."</p></blockquote>

<p>Some of his good ones have been
already implied. He is hardy, enduring,
can live on grass, do without groom
or stable. You may shoot off his
back&mdash;or sleep on it, for his pace is
the easiest of motions. He is never
ill, save of one complaint, which resembles
glanders, (although it is a
different disease,) and is always fatal.
This malady he evidently contracts in
the pastures, for horses kept in the
stable, and never allowed to graze, are
not subject to it. He is cheap to buy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A horse good enough for all ordinary
purposes may be bought from £9 to £15.
I once rode a journey of two hundred and
thirty miles with the same set of horses,
(four in number, one for my servant, one
for myself, one for saddle-bags, and
another for changing) in four days. The
most expensive of the four cost me £12,
and the cheapest £4, 10s. It is true that
I fed them well on the road, but a
Dutch boer would have taken them the
same distance without a handful of corn
all the way."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mounted on one of these serviceable
brutes, Mr Cole rambled about the
colony, sleeping at inns when he
found them, but much oftener profiting
by the boundless hospitality of the
Cape farmers, and making acquaintance
with all sorts of people, from
puny Cockney settlers to gigantic
Dutch boers. The latter are&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The finest men in the colony. I have
seen them constantly from six feet two to
six feet six inches in height; broad and
muscular in proportion. Their strength
is immense. They are great admirers of
feats of daring, strength, and activity.
A mighty hunter, such as Gordon Cumming,
would be welcomed with open arms
by every Dutch boer in South Africa.
Poor Moultrie, of the 75th, the 'lion-hunter'
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>, was one of their
idols. So is Bain, the 'long-haired,' who
has made some half-dozen excursions into
the far wilderness in search of the lord of
the forest and all his subjects. They
hunt far more than the English farmers,
and are, as I have said, 'crack' shots,
though they use a great, long, awkward,
heavy, flint-locked gun, that would make
Purdey or Westley Richards shudder
with disgust."</p></blockquote>

<p>Frugal and industrious, these stalwart
descendants of Hollanders have
one great fault, almost a fatal one in
a new country. They have a rooted
antipathy to novelty and improvement.
They use the same lumbering
plough their big-breeched forefathers
imported from the Low Countries
some eighty years ago, although it requires
twelve strong oxen to draw it.
They reject steam, and pound their
corn instead of grinding it. Despising
flails, they completely spoil their
straw by having the grain trodden
out by horses or oxen. Of the English
settlers, the Cockneys make the
best farmers, "because, coming without
any previous knowledge of the art
they intend to follow, they take
advice of those whom experience
enables to give it, instead of trying to
manage things in South Africa as
they do in England." Stories are
traditionally cited, of inexperienced
Londoners, just landed at the Cape,
purchasing a flock of sheep as breeding
stock, and discovering them (too
late) to be wethers; and of another
who planted split pease to raise a
crop ready for use; but such instances
of ignorance, Mr Cole assures us, are
by no means common.</p>

<p>The present unfortunate condition
of the Cape Colony, and the destructive
war now raging there, give
peculiar interest to that portion of
Mr Cole's book which relates to the
Kafirs. During the greater part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
his residence at the Cape, these
troublesome savages were on their
good behaviour, and he was enabled
to become personally acquainted with
them, and especially with their powerful
chief Macomo. Riding from
Graham's Town to Fort Beaufort,
through that immense jungle and
favourite Kafir lurking-place, Fish
River Bush, he paused to bait at a
roadside inn, and entered into chat
with his host, who, on hearing that he
had never been in Kafirland, pointed
out to him a distant mountain.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A very noted place, sir," he said,
"is that mountain. It is in the territory
of the Kafir chief Macomo. When that
rascal wants to attack the colony, or his
neighbours, the other chiefs, he lights a
great fire on the top of that hill at night,
and, on seeing it, every Kafir in his
dominions immediately flocks to his
standard, and he can collect ten thousand
armed men, sir."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Cole expressed a fervent hope
that it would be long before Macomo
lit his fire, but the innkeeper expected
it would shortly blaze; and
the innkeeper was right. At Fort
Beaufort Mr Cole first saw the great
Kafir, dressed in cast-off European
clothes, but without shirt or stockings,
and more than half-drunk. He
won his favour by lending him sixpence,
and received an invitation to
visit him at his kraal, a very few
miles from Fort Beaufort. Accordingly,
next morning he mounted his
horse, and rode into Kafirland.
From Chapter X. we glean some of
his first impressions.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Kafir is certainly a fine animal.
He is tall, well-knit, clean-limbed, and
graceful in his motions. It is rare to see
a Kafir with any personal deformity,
however trifling. I have seen some
dozen races of coloured people, and I
have no hesitation in pronouncing the
Kafirs by far the finest of them. Their
features are not negro; though some of
them (especially Macomo, who is the
ugliest man in his dominions) partake
very much of that character. Their
colour varies from almost black to a
light copper hue. Amongst them I frequently
met with Albinos. These are
certainly the most repulsive-looking
creatures I ever beheld. Their skin is
dead white, not the whiteness of a delicate
European skin, but the colour of a
white horse&mdash;it is scaly and coarse; their
eyes are pink like those of a ferret; and
their hair very much the colour of a
ferret's coat, though still woolly and
tufted."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Kafirs Mr Cole met upon the
road scowled at him in no friendly
manner, but dared not rob a visiter
to their chief. Macomo received him
well, regaled him on beefsteaks and
coffee, tried hard to sell him horses
or cattle, expressed most hypocritical
affection for the English, and extracted
another sixpence from him,
in exchange for a stick.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I rode back to Fort Beaufort, well
pleased with my visit, but more than
ever satisfied of the natural cunning,
avarice, craft, and dishonesty, the low
moral nature, and utter untrustworthiness
of Kafirs in general, and, above all,
of Macomo."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Cole makes some sensible suggestions
for averting future wars with
the Kafirs, and securing the tranquillity
of the colony. Whilst justly
disapproving certain points of the constitution
tardily granted to the Cape,
he admits it to be a great improvement
upon the present state of things.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When the Cape colonists," he says,
"commence self-government, doubtless
one of their first acts will be to embody
a militia throughout the land. Every
man in the country, between certain
ages, will be a soldier, and the most fit
and effectual soldier to contend with the
savage enemies across the boundary.
This will be, in effect, a revival of the
old Dutch Commando system&mdash;a system,
with all its faults, the most efficient in
repressing the rapine and murder of the
Kafirs, and under which no such war as
the present could have originated."</p></blockquote>

<p>The abolition of this system, which
allowed the Dutch boers, when aggrieved
or plundered by the Kafirs,
to muster in bodies, recover their
cattle by the strong hand, and chastise
the robbers, has always been a
subject of bitter complaint and discontent
with the frontier farmers.
They fear not the Kafirs, if they
are but allowed to defend themselves
and their property, and to retaliate
with the strong hand. Give them thus
much licence, and, says Mr Cole,
"I have no hesitation in saying that
the colonists of the border would very
soon settle the Kafir question." Let
it be clearly understood what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Cape "bush" is. It is a dense
thicket studded with thorns, and
impenetrable to persons in ordinary
European garb. The Hottentots and
colonists wear leather "crackers"&mdash;as
breeches are called at the Cape&mdash;which
in some degree protect them;
and the Kafirs, naked and with their
bodies greased all over&mdash;blest, besides,
with thick skins&mdash;crawl through
it on their bellies. Speaking of Fish
River Bush, Mr Cole says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"One of the greatest benefits that
could be conferred on the colony would
be its entire destruction by fire. But I
fear it will not burn; and so it will continue
to harbour wild beasts in peace,
and Kafirs in war time. All the Kafir
nation could hide in it, and be out of
sight and out of reach of English eyes
and English bullets. At the first symptom
of an impending attack on the colony,
the report always flies like wild-fire,
'The Fish River Bush is full of Kafirs.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Then are sent out against these
lithe and dusky savages, who can
writhe like snakes through the underwood,
and whose brown hide is scarce
distinguishable from the tints of the
rocks and branches, and aloe-stems
amongst which they lurk, a party of
red-coated Englishmen, to be shot
down by invisible foes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A splendid target that same scarlet
coat," exclaims Mr Cole. "Even when
those bushes intervene, though you see
not the man&mdash;neither his face, nor his
shako, nor his trousers&mdash;yet <em>there</em> is the
piece of scarlet cloth glaring through the
boughs; take steady aim at that, for a
soldier's heart beats behind it, and a bullet
sent through the gaudy garment hurls
one more shilling target to the dust."</p></blockquote>

<p>Nearly six years ago, when the
subject of military punishments was
before Parliament, we proposed and
urged certain reforms and ameliorations
in the equipment of the army,
some of which are now in process of
adoption, whilst others, we have little
doubt, will ere long be forced upon the
authorities by public opinion and their
manifest necessity. We then denounced
scarlet, "first, because it is
tawdry, and, secondly, as rendering the
soldier an easier mark than a less glaring
colour. Blue coats and grey trousers
are the colours we should like to see
adopted in our service, preserving
always the green for the rifles, who
ought to be ten times as numerous as
they are, as we shall discover whenever
we come to a brush with the
Yankees, or with our old and gallant
opponents, the French."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
</p>

<p>Our troops, it is understood, are
about to get the rifles; of the scarlet
we hope soon to see them get rid. A
very inferior foe to either American
or Frenchman has sufficed to show
the necessity of marching with the
century, at least in matters military.
The long guns of the naked Kafirs
outshoot our regulation muskets; and
earnest and unanswerable representations&mdash;amongst
which must prominently
be reckoned the able letters of
that practical and experienced soldier,
Sir Charles Shaw&mdash;have opened official
eyes to the advantages of grooved
barrels over smooth bores. Soon we
hope to see scarlet replaced by a more
rational and less brilliant colour,
knapsacks lightened, and pipe-clayed
belts abolished. We advocated blue
for the soldier's dress, because tailors,
professional and amateur, have still
so potential a voice in our military
councils, that we scarcely dare hope
the adoption of less becoming tints;
otherwise, grey, green, or brown
mixtures, although not showy on
parade, will be admitted by all military
men who have seen service&mdash;especially
skirmishing service in bush,
mountains, or forest&mdash;to constitute
by far the least visible uniform, and
worst mark. In time, perhaps, these
sober but service-like colours may be
introduced. Perhaps, too, in time,
the Horse Guards will discern the
wisdom of keeping heavy cavalry for
home parades, or European wars&mdash;should
the latter unfortunately occur&mdash;and
of sending the lightest and
most lightly-equipped of their dragoons
in pursuit of nimble savages, in
colonies too distant to ship horses to,
and where chargers, up to the weight
of the men, are unobtainable.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When the 7th Dragoon Guards came
out to the Cape, they had considerable
difficulty in horsing the regiment, though
they took as low a standard as fifteen
hands for their chargers. Even at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
standard, the men in full dress, with their
brass helmets, carbines and accoutrements,
looked rather absurdly mounted,
and reminded one forcibly of the hobby-horse
figures in a Christmas pantomime."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>When we picture to ourselves these
bravo "heavies"&mdash;so formidable if
opposed to French or German dragoons&mdash;inefficiently
floundering, on
overweighted horses, through bush
and brushwood, after the agile barbarians
of South Africa, and when we
contrast them with the really "<em>light</em>-horse"
we have seen shipped from
Provençal ports for service in Algeria,
we cannot but admit, however unwillingly,
that these things are better
managed in France than on our side
of the Channel. May it soon be

<h3>BOOK X&mdash;INITIAL CHAPTER.</h3>

<p>It is observed by a very pleasant
writer&mdash;read now-a-days only by the
brave pertinacious few who still
struggle hard to rescue from the
House of Pluto the souls of departed
authors, jostled and chaced as those
souls are by the noisy footsteps of the
living&mdash;it is observed by the admirable
Charron, that "judgment and
wisdom is not only the best, but the
happiest portion God Almighty hath
distributed amongst men; for though
this distribution be made with a very
uneven hand, yet nobody thinks himself
stinted or ill-dealt with, but he
that hath never so little is contented
in <em>this</em> respect."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>And, certainly, the present narrative
may serve in notable illustration
of the remark so drily made by the
witty and wise preacher. For whether
our friend Riccabocca deduce
theories for daily life from the great
folio of Machiavel; or that promising
young gentleman, Mr Randal Leslie,
interpret the power of knowledge into
the art of being too knowing for dull
honest folks to cope with him; or
acute Dick Avenel push his way up
the social ascent with a blow for
those before, and a kick for those
behind him, after the approved fashion
of your strong New Man; or Baron
Levy&mdash;that cynical impersonation of
Gold&mdash;compare himself to the Magnetic
Rock in the Arabian tale, to
which the nails in every ship that
approaches the influence of the loadstone
fly from the planks, and a shipwreck
per day adds its waifs to the
Rock: questionless, at least, it is, that
each of those personages believed
that Providence had bestowed on him
an elder son's inheritance of wisdom.
Nor, were we to glance towards the
obscurer paths of life, should we find
good Parson Dale deem himself worse
off than the rest of the world in this
precious commodity&mdash;as, indeed, he
had signally evinced of late in that
shrewd guess of his touching Professor
Moss;&mdash;even plain Squire Hazeldean
took it for granted that he
could teach Audley Egerton a thing
or two worth knowing in politics;
Mr Stirn thought that there was no
branch of useful lore on which he
could not instruct the Squire; and
Sprott, the tinker, with his bag full
of tracts and lucifer matches, regarded
the whole framework of modern
society, from a rick to a constitution,
with the profound disdain of a revolutionary
philosopher. Considering
that every individual thus brings into
the stock of the world so vast a share
of intelligence, it cannot but excite
our wonder to find that Oxenstiern is
popularly held to be right when he
said, "See, my son, how little wisdom
it requires to govern states;"&mdash;that
is, Men! That so many millions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
of persons, each with a profound
assurance that he is possessed of an
exalted sagacity, should concur in the
ascendency of a few inferior intellects,
according to a few stupid, prosy,
matter-of-fact rules as old as the hills,
is a phenomenon very discreditable to
the spirit and energy of the aggregate
human species! It creates no surprise
that one sensible watch-dog
should control the movements of a
flock of silly grass-eating sheep; but
that two or three silly grass-eating
sheep should give the law to whole
flocks of such mighty sensible watch-dogs&mdash;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Diavolo!</i>
Dr Riccabocca, explain
<em>that</em> if you can! And wonderfully
strange it is; that notwithstanding
all the march of enlightenment,
notwithstanding our progressive discoveries
in the laws of nature&mdash;our
railways, steam-engines, animal magnetism,
and electro-biology&mdash;we have
never made any improvement that is
generally acknowledged, since Men
ceased to be troglodytes and nomads,
in the old-fashioned gamut of flats
and sharps, which attunes into irregular
social jog-trot all the generations
that pass from the cradle to the
grave;&mdash;still, "<em>the desire for something
we have not</em>" impels all the
energies that keep us in movement,
for good or for ill, according to the
checks or the directions of each
favourite desire.</p>

<p>A friend of mine once said to a
<em>millionaire</em>, whom he saw for ever
engaged in making money which he
never seemed to have any pleasure in
spending, "Pray, Mr &mdash;&mdash;, will you
answer me one question: You are
said to have two millions, and you
spend £600 a-year. In order to rest
and enjoy, what will content you?"</p>

<p>"A little more," answered the <em>millionaire</em>.
That "little more" is the
mainspring of civilisation. Nobody
ever gets it!</p>

<p>"Philus," saith a Latin writer,
"was not so rich as Lælius; Lælius
was not so rich as Scipio; Scipio was
not so rich as Crassus; and Crassus
was not so rich&mdash;as he wished to
be!" If John Bull were once contented,
Manchester might shut up its
mills. It is the "little more" that
makes a mere trifle of the National
Debt!&mdash;Long life to it!</p>

<p>Still, mend our law-books as we
will, one is forced to confess that
knaves are often seen in fine linen,
and honest men in the most shabby
old rags; and still, notwithstanding
the exceptions, knavery is a very
hazardous game; and honesty, on the
whole, by far the best policy. Still,
most of the Ten Commandments remain
at the core of all the Pandects
and Institutes that keep our hands
off our neighbours' throats, wives,
and pockets; still, every year shows
that the Parson's maxim&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non quieta
movere</i>&mdash;is as prudent for the health
of communities as when Apollo recommended
his votaries not to rake
up a fever by stirring the Lake Camarina;
still people, thank Heaven,
decline to reside in parallelograms;
and the surest token that we live
under a free government is, when we
are governed by persons whom we
have a full right to imply, by our
censure and ridicule, are blockheads
compared to ourselves! Stop that
delightful privilege, and, by Jove!
sir, there is neither pleasure nor
honour in being governed at all!
You might as well be&mdash;a Frenchman!</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>The Italian and his friend are
closeted together.</p>

<p>"And why have you left your home
in &mdash;&mdash;shire? and why this new
change of name?"</p>

<p>"Peschiera is in England."</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>"And bent on discovering me;
and, it is said, of stealing from me my
child."</p>

<p>"He has had the assurance to lay
wagers that he will win the hand of
your heiress. I know that too; and
therefore I have come to England&mdash;first
to baffle his design&mdash;for I do not
think your fears exaggerated&mdash;and
next to learn from you how to follow
up a clue which, unless I am too
sanguine, may lead to his ruin, and
your unconditional restoration. Listen
to me. You are aware that, after the
skirmish with Peschiera's armed hirelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
sent in search of you, I received
a polite message from the Austrian
government, requesting me to leave
its Italian domains. Now, as I hold
it the obvious duty of any foreigner,
admitted to the hospitality of a state, to
refrain from all participation in its civil
disturbances, so I thought my honour
assailed at this intimation, and went
at once to Vienna to explain to the
Minister there, (to whom I was personally
known,) that though I had, as
became man to man, aided to protect
a refugee, who had taken shelter under
my roof, from the infuriated soldiers
at the command of his private foe, I
had not only not shared in any attempt
at revolt, but dissuaded, as far as I
could, my Italian friends from their
enterprise; and that because, without
discussing its merits, I believed, as a
military man and a cool spectator,
the enterprise could only terminate in
fruitless bloodshed. I was enabled to
establish my explanation by satisfactory
proof; and my acquaintance with
the Minister assumed something of
the character of friendship. I was
then in a position to advocate your
cause, and to state your original reluctance
to enter into the plots of the
insurgents. I admitted freely that you
had such natural desire for the independence
of your native land, that,
had the standard of Italy been boldly
hoisted by its legitimate chiefs, or at
the common uprising of its whole
people, you would have been found in
the van, amidst the ranks of your
countrymen; but I maintained that
you would never have shared in a
conspiracy frantic in itself, and defiled
by the lawless schemes and sordid
ambition of its main projectors, had
you not been betrayed and decoyed
into it by the misrepresentations and
domestic treachery of your kinsman&mdash;the
very man who denounced you.
Unfortunately, of this statement I had
no proof but your own word. I made,
however, so far an impression in your
favour, and, it may be, against the
traitor, that your property was not
confiscated to the State, nor handed
over, upon the plea of your civil death,
to your kinsman."</p>

<p>"How!&mdash;I do not understand.
Peschiera has the property?"</p>

<p>"He holds the revenues but of one
half upon pleasure, and they would be
withdrawn, could I succeed in establishing
the case that exists against
him. I was forbidden before to mention
this to you; the Minister, not
inexcusably, submitted you to the probation
of unconditional exile. Your
grace might depend upon your own
forbearance from farther conspiracies&mdash;forgive
the word. I need not say I
was permitted to return to Lombardy.
I found, on my arrival, that&mdash;that
your unhappy wife had been to my
house, and exhibited great despair at
hearing of my departure."</p>

<p>Riccabocca knit his dark brows,
and breathed hard.</p>

<p>"I did not judge it necessary to
acquaint you with this circumstance,
nor did it much affect me. I believed
in her guilt&mdash;and what could now
avail her remorse, if remorse she felt?
Shortly afterwards, I heard that she
was no more."</p>

<p>"Yes," muttered Riccabocca, "she
died in the same year that I left Italy.
It must be a strong reason that can
excuse a friend for reminding me even
that she once lived!"</p>

<p>"I come at once to that reason,"
said L'Estrange gently. "This autumn
I was roaming through Switzerland,
and, in one of my pedestrian excursions
amidst the mountains, I met with
an accident, which confined me for
some days to a sofa at a little inn in
an obscure village. My hostess was
an Italian; and, as I had left my servant
at a town at some distance, I
required her attention till I could
write to him to come to me. I was
thankful for her cares, and amused by
her Italian babble. We became very
good friends. She told me she had
been servant to a lady of great rank,
who had died in Switzerland; and
that, being enriched by the generosity
of her mistress, she had married a
Swiss innkeeper, and his people had
become hers. My servant arrived,
and my hostess learned my name,
which she did not know before. She
came into my room greatly agitated.
In brief, this woman had been servant
to your wife. She had accompanied
her to my villa, and known of her
anxiety to see me, as your friend.
The government had assigned to your
wife your palace at Milan, with a
competent income. She had refused
to accept of either. Failing to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
me, she had set off towards England,
resolved upon seeing yourself; for the
journals had stated that to England
you had escaped."</p>

<p>"She dared!&mdash;shameless! And
see, but a moment before, I had forgotten
all but her grave in a foreign
soil&mdash;and these tears had forgiven
her," murmured the Italian.</p>

<p>"Let them forgive her still," said
Harley, with all his exquisite sweetness
of look and tone. "I resume.
On entering Switzerland, your wife's
health, which you know was always
delicate, gave way. To fatigue and
anxiety succeeded fever, and delirium
ensued. She had taken with her but
this one female attendant&mdash;the sole
one she could trust&mdash;on leaving home.
She suspected Peschiera to have bribed
her household. In the presence of this
woman she raved of her innocence&mdash;in
accents of terror and aversion, denounced
your kinsman&mdash;and called
on you to vindicate her name and
your own."</p>

<p>"Ravings indeed! Poor Paulina!"
groaned Riccabocca, covering his face
with both hands.</p>

<p>"But in her delirium there were
lucid intervals. In one of these she
rose, in spite of all her servant could
do to restrain her, took from her desk
several letters, and reading them
over, exclaimed piteously, 'But how
to get them to him?&mdash;whom to trust?
And his friend is gone!' Then an
idea seemed suddenly to flash upon
her, for she uttered a joyous exclamation,
sate down, and wrote long
and rapidly; enclosed what she wrote,
with all the letters, in one packet,
which she sealed carefully, and bade
her servant carry to the post, with
many injunctions to take it with her
own hand, and pay the charge on it.
'For, oh!' said she (I repeat the
words as my informant told them to
me)&mdash;'for, oh! this is my sole chance
to prove to my husband that, though
I have erred, I am not the guilty
thing he believes me; the sole chance,
too, to redeem my error, and restore,
perhaps, to my husband his country,
to my child her heritage.' The servant
took the letter to the post; and
when she returned, her lady was asleep,
with a smile upon her face. But from
that sleep she woke again delirious,
and before the next morning her soul
had fled." Here Riccabocca lifted one
hand from his face, and grasped Harley's
arm, as if mutely beseeching him
to pause. The heart of the man
struggled hard with his pride and his
philosophy; and it was long before
Harley could lead him to regard the
worldly prospects which this last communication
from his wife might open
to his ruined fortunes. Not, indeed,
till Riccabocca had persuaded himself,
and half persuaded Harley, (for strong,
indeed, was all presumption of guilt
against the dead,) that his wife's protestations
of innocence from all but
error had been but ravings.</p>

<p>"Be this as it may," said Harley,
"there seems every reason to suppose
that the letters enclosed were Peschiera's
correspondence, and that, if
so, these would establish the proof of
his influence over your wife, and of
his perfidious machinations against
yourself. I resolved, before coming
hither, to go round by Vienna. There
I heard with dismay that Peschiera
had not only obtained the imperial
sanction to demand your daughter's
hand, but had boasted to his profligate
circle that he should succeed;
and he was actually on his road to
England. I saw at once that could
this design, by any fraud or artifice,
be successful with Violante, (for of
your consent, I need not say, I did
not dream,) the discovery of this
packet, whatever its contents, would
be useless: his end would be secured.
I saw also that his success would suffice
for ever to clear his name; for
his success must imply your consent,
(it would be to disgrace your daughter,
to assert that she had married
without it,) and your consent would
be his acquittal. I saw, too, with
alarm, that to all means for the accomplishment
of his project he would be
urged by despair; for his debts are
great, and his character nothing but
new wealth can support. I knew that
he was able, bold, determined, and
that he had taken with him a large
supply of money, borrowed upon
usury;&mdash;in a word, I trembled for
you both. I have now seen your
daughter, and I tremble no more.
Accomplished seducer as Peschiera
boasts himself, the first look upon her
face, so sweet yet so noble, convinced
me that she is proof against a legion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
of Peschieras. Now, then, return we
to this all-important subject&mdash;to this
packet. It never reached you. Long
years have passed since then. Does
it exist still? Into whose hands would
it have fallen? Try to summon up
all your recollections. The servant
could not remember the name of the
person to whom it was addressed;
she only insisted that the name began
with a B, that it was directed to
England, and that to England she
accordingly paid the postage. Whom,
then, with a name that begins with
B, or (in case the servant's memory
here mislead her) whom did you or
your wife know, during your visit to
England, with sufficient intimacy to
make it probable that she would select
such a person for her confidant?"</p>

<p>"I cannot conceive," said Riccabocca,
shaking his head. "We came
to England shortly after our marriage.
Paulina was affected by the climate.
She spoke not a word of English, and
indeed not even French as might
have been expected from her birth, for
her father was poor, and thoroughly
Italian. She refused all society. I
went, it is true, somewhat into the
London world&mdash;enough to induce me
to shrink from the contrast that my
second visit as a beggared refugee
would have made to the reception I
met with on my first&mdash;but I formed
no intimate friendships. I recall no
one whom she could have written to
as intimate with me."</p>

<p>"But," persisted Harley, "think
again. Was there no lady well
acquainted with Italian, and with
whom, perhaps, for that very reason,
your wife became familiar?"</p>

<p>"Ah, it is true. There was one
old lady of retired habits, but who
had been much in Italy. Lady&mdash;Lady&mdash;I
remember&mdash;Lady Jane
Horton."</p>

<p>"Horton&mdash;Lady Jane!" exclaimed
Harley; "again! thrice in one day&mdash;is
this wound never to scar over?"
Then, noting Riccabocca's look of surprise,
he said, "Excuse me, my friend;
I listen to you with renewed interest.
Lady Jane was a distant relation of
my own; she judged me, perhaps,
harshly&mdash;and I have some painful
associations with her name; but she
was a woman of many virtues. Your
wife knew her?"</p>

<p>"Not, however, intimately&mdash;still,
better than any one else in London.
But Paulina would not have written
to her; she knew that Lady Jane
had died shortly after her own departure
from England. I myself was
summoned back to Italy on pressing
business; she was too unwell to journey
with me as rapidly as I was
obliged to travel; indeed, illness detained
her several weeks in England.
In this interval she might have made
acquaintances. Ah, now I see; I
guess. You say the name began with
B. Paulina, in my absence, engaged
a companion; it was at my suggestion&mdash;a
Mrs Bertram. This lady
accompanied her abroad. Paulina
became excessively attached to her,
she knew Italian so well. Mrs Bertram
left her on the road, and returned
to England, for some private affairs
of her own. I forget why or wherefore;
if, indeed, I ever asked or
learned. Paulina missed her sadly,
often talked of her, wondered why
she never heard from her. No doubt
it was to this Mrs Bertram that she
wrote!"</p>

<p>"And you don't know the lady's
friends, or address?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Nor who recommended her to
your wife?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Probably Lady Jane Horton?"</p>

<p>"It may be so. Very likely."</p>

<p>"I will follow up this track, slight
as it is."</p>

<p>"But if Mrs Bertram received the
communication, how comes it that it
never reached&mdash;O, fool that I am,
how should it! I, who guarded so
carefully my incognito!"</p>

<p>"True. This your wife could not
foresee; she would naturally imagine
that your residence in England would
be easily discovered. But many
years must have passed since your
wife lost sight of this Mrs Bertram,
if their acquaintance was made so
soon after your marriage; and now
it is a long time to retrace&mdash;long before
even your Violante was born."</p>

<p>"Alas! yes. I lost two fair sons
in the interval. Violante was born to
me as the child of sorrow."</p>

<p>"And to make sorrow lovely! how
beautiful she is!"</p>

<p>The father smiled proudly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where, in the loftiest houses of
Europe, find a husband worthy of
such a prize?"</p>

<p>"You forget that I am still an
exile&mdash;she still dowerless. You forget
that I am pursued by Peschiera; that
I would rather see her a beggar's wife&mdash;than&mdash;Pah,
the very thought maddens
me, it is so foul. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Corpo di Bacco!</i>
I have been glad to find her a husband
already."</p>

<p>"Already! Then that young man
spoke truly?"</p>

<p>"What young man?"</p>

<p>"Randal Leslie. How! You know
him?" Here a brief explanation followed.
Harley heard with attentive
ear, and marked vexation, the particulars
of Riccabocca's connection and
implied engagement with Leslie.</p>

<p>"There is something very suspicious
to me in all this," said he.
"Why should this young man have
so sounded me as to Violante's chance
of losing fortune if she married an
Englishman?"</p>

<p>"Did he? O, pooh! excuse him.
It was but his natural wish to seem
ignorant of all about me. He did not
know enough of my intimacy with
you to betray my secret."</p>

<p>"But he knew enough of it&mdash;must
have known enough to have made it
right that he should tell you I was in
England. He does not seem to have
done so."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;<em>that</em> is strange&mdash;yet scarcely
strange; for, when we last met, his
head was full of other things&mdash;love
and marriage. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Basta!</i> youth will be
youth."</p>

<p>"He has no youth left in him!"
exclaimed Harley, passionately. "I
doubt if he ever had any. He is one
of those men who come into the world
with the pulse of a centenarian. You
and I never shall be as old&mdash;as he was
in long-clothes. Ah, you may laugh;
but I am never wrong in my instincts.
I disliked him at the first&mdash;his eye,
his smile, his voice, his very footstep.
It is madness in you to countenance
such a marriage: it may destroy all
chance of your restoration."</p>

<p>"Better that than infringe my word
once passed."</p>

<p>"No, no," exclaimed Harley;
"your word is not passed&mdash;it shall
not be passed. Nay, never look so
piteously at me. At all events, pause
till we know more of this young man. If
he be worthy of her without a
dower, why, then, let him lose you
your heritage. I should have no more
to say."</p>

<p>"But why lose me my heritage?"</p>

<p>"Do you think the Austrian government
would suffer your estates to
pass to this English jackanapes, a
clerk in a public office? O, sage in
theory, why are you such a simpleton
in action!"</p>

<p>Nothing moved by this taunt, Riccabocca
rubbed his hands, and then
stretched them comfortably over the
fire.</p>

<p>"My friend," said he, "the heritage
would pass to my son&mdash;a dowry
only goes to the daughter."</p>

<p>"But you have no son."</p>

<p>"Hush! I am going to have one;
my Jemima informed me of it yesterday
morning; and it was upon that
information that I resolved to speak to
Leslie. Am I a simpleton now?"</p>

<p>"Going to have a son," repeated
Harley, looking very bewildered;
"how do you know it is to be a son?"</p>

<p>"Physiologists are agreed," said
the sage positively, "that where the
husband is much older than the wife,
and there has been a long interval
without children before she condescends
to increase the population of
the world&mdash;she (that is, it is at least
as nine to four)&mdash;she brings into the
world a male. I consider that point,
therefore, as settled, according to the
calculations of statistics and the researches
of naturalists."</p>

<p>Harley could not help laughing,
though he was still angry and disturbed.</p>

<p>"The same man as ever; always
the fool of philosophy."</p>

<p>"<i lang="lita" xml:lang="it">Cospetto!</i>" said Riccabocca, "I
am rather the philosopher of fools. And
talking of that, shall I present
you to my Jemima?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but in turn I must present
you to one who remembers with gratitude
your kindness, and whom your
philosophy, for a wonder, has not
ruined. Some time or other you must
explain that to me. Excuse me for
a moment; I will go for him."</p>

<p>"For him;&mdash;for whom? In my
position I must be cautious; and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will answer for his faith and
discretion. Meanwhile, order dinner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
and let me and my friend stay to
share it."</p>

<p>"Dinner? <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Corpo di Bacco!</i>&mdash;not
that Bacchus can help us here. What
will Jemima say?"</p>

<p>"Henpecked man, settle that with
your connubial tyrant. But dinner it
must be."</p>

<p>I leave the reader to imagine the
delight of Leonard at seeing once
more Riccabocca unchanged, and
Violante so improved; and the kind
Jemima, too. And their wonder at
him and his history, his books and
his fame. He narrated his struggles
and adventures with a simplicity that
removed from a story so personal the
character of egotism. But when he
came to speak of Helen, he was brief
and reserved.</p>

<p>Violante would have questioned
more closely; but, to Leonard's relief,
Harley interposed.</p>

<p>"You shall see her whom he speaks
of, before long, and question her yourself."</p>

<p>With these words, Harley turned
the young man's narrative into new
directions; and Leonard's words
again flowed freely. Thus the evening
passed away happily to all save
Riccabocca. But the thought of his
dead wife rose ever and anon before
him; and yet when it did, and became
too painful, he crept nearer to
Jemima, and looked in her simple
face, and pressed her cordial hand.
And yet the monster had implied to
Harley that his comforter was a fool&mdash;so
she was, to love so contemptible
a slanderer of herself, and her sex.</p>

<p>Violante was in a state of blissful
excitement; she could not analyse her
own joy. But her conversation was
chiefly with Leonard; and the most
silent of all was Harley. He sate
listening to Leonard's warm, yet unpretending
eloquence&mdash;that eloquence
which flows so naturally from genius,
when thoroughly at its ease, and not
chilled back on itself by hard unsympathising
hearers&mdash;listened, yet more
charmed, to the sentiments less profound,
yet no less earnest&mdash;sentiments
so feminine, yet so noble, with
which Violante's fresh virgin heart
responded to the poet's kindling soul.
Those sentiments of hers were so unlike
all he heard in the common world&mdash;so
akin to himself in his gone
youth! Occasionally&mdash;at some high
thought of her own, or some lofty line
from Italian song, that she cited with
lighted eyes, and in melodious accents&mdash;occasionally
he reared his
knightly head, and his lip quivered,
as if he had heard the sound of a
trumpet. The inertness of long years
was shaken. The Heroic, that lay
deep beneath all the humours of his
temperament, was reached, appealed
to; and stirred within him, rousing
up all the bright associations connected
with it, and long dormant.
When he rose to take leave, surprised
at the lateness of the hour, Harley
said, in a tone that bespoke the sincerity
of the compliment, "I thank you
for the happiest hours I have known
for years." His eye dwelt on Violante
as he spoke. But timidity returned
to her with his words&mdash;at his
look; and it was no longer the inspired
muse, but the bashful girl that
stood before him.</p>

<p>"And when shall I see you again?"
asked Riccabocca disconsolately, following
his guest to the door.</p>

<p>"When? Why, of course, to-morrow.
Adieu! my friend. No
wonder you have borne your exile so
patiently,&mdash;with such a child!"</p>

<p>He took Leonard's arm, and walked
with him to the inn where he had left
his horse. Leonard spoke of Violante
with enthusiasm. Harley was silent.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>The next day a somewhat old-fashioned,
but exceedingly patrician,
equipage stopped at Riccabocca's
garden-gate. Giacomo, who, from a
bedroom window, had caught sight of
it winding towards the house, was
seized with undefinable terror when
he beheld it pause before their walls,
and heard the shrill summons at the
portal. He rushed into his master's
presence, and implored him not to
stir&mdash;not to allow any one to give
ingress to the enemies the machine
might disgorge. "I have heard,"
said he, "how a town in Italy&mdash;I
think it was Bologna&mdash;was once taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
and given to the sword, by incautiously
admitting a wooden horse,
full of the troops of Barbarossa, and
all manner of bombs and Congreve
rockets."</p>

<p>"The story is differently told in
Virgil," quoth Riccabocca, peeping
out of the window. "Nevertheless,
the machine looks very large and suspicious;
unloose Pompey!"</p>

<p>"Father," said Violante, colouring,
"it is your friend Lord L'Estrange;
I hear his voice."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Quite. How can I be mistaken?"</p>

<p>"Go, then, Giacomo; but take
Pompey with thee&mdash;and give the
alarm, if we are deceived."</p>

<p>But Violante was right; and in a
few moments Lord L'Estrange was
seen walking up the garden, and giving
the arm to two ladies.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Riccabocca, composing
his dressing-robe round him, "go,
my child, and summon Jemima. Man
to man; but, for Heaven's sake, woman
to woman."</p>

<p>Harley had brought his mother and
Helen, in compliment to the ladies of
his friend's household.</p>

<p>The proud Countess knew that she
was in the presence of Adversity, and
her salute to Riccabocca was only
less respectful than that with which
she would have rendered homage to
her sovereign. But Riccabocca, always
gallant to the sex that he pretended
to despise, was not to be outdone
in ceremony; and the bow which
replied to the curtsey would have
edified the rising generation, and
delighted such surviving relicts of the
old Court breeding as may linger yet
amidst the gloomy pomp of the Faubourg
St Germain. These dues paid
to etiquette, the Countess briefly introduced
Helen, as Miss Digby, and
seated herself near the exile. In a
few moments the two elder personages
became quite at home with each
other; and really, perhaps, Riccabocca
had never, since we have known
him, showed to such advantage as
by the side of his polished, but somewhat
formal visiter. Both had lived
so little with our modern, ill-bred
age! They took out their manners
of a former race, with a sort of pride
in airing once more such fine lace and
superb brocade. Riccabocca gave
truce to the shrewd but homely wisdom
of his proverbs&mdash;perhaps he
remembered that Lord Chesterfield
denounces proverbs as vulgar;&mdash;and
gaunt though his figure, and far from
elegant though his dressing-robe,
there was that about him which spoke
undeniably of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand seigneur</i>&mdash;of
one to whom a Marquis de Dangeau
would have offered a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fauteuil</i> by the
side of the Rohans and Montmorencies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Helen and Harley
seated themselves a little apart, and
were both silent&mdash;the first, from timidity;
the second, from abstraction.
At length the door opened, and Harley
suddenly sprang to his feet&mdash;Violante
and Jemima entered. Lady
Lansmere's eyes first rested on the
daughter, and she could scarcely refrain
from an exclamation of admiring
surprise; but then, when she caught
sight of Mrs Riccabocca's somewhat
humble, yet not obsequious mien&mdash;looking
a little shy, a little homely,
yet still thoroughly a gentlewoman,
(though of your plain rural kind of
that genus)&mdash;she turned from the
daughter, and with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savoir vivre</i>
of the fine old school, paid her first
respects to the wife; respects literally,
for her manner implied respect,&mdash;but
it was more kind, simple, and
cordial than the respect she had
shown to Riccabocca;&mdash;as the sage
himself had said, here "it was Woman
to Woman." And then she
took Violante's hand in both hers,
and gazed on her as if she could not
resist the pleasure of contemplating
so much beauty. "My son," she said
softly, and with a half sigh&mdash;"my
son in vain told me not to be surprised.
This is the first time I have ever
known reality exceed description!"</p>

<p>Violante's blush here made her
still more beautiful; and as the
Countess returned to Riccabocca, she
stole gently to Helen's side.</p>

<p>"Miss Digby, my ward," said
Harley pointedly, observing that his
mother had neglected her duty of presenting
Helen to the ladies. He then
reseated himself, and conversed with
Mrs Riccabocca; but his bright quick
eye glanced ever at the two girls.
They were about the same age&mdash;and
youth was all that, to the superficial
eye, they seemed to have in common.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
A greater contrast could not well be
conceived; and, what is strange, both
gained by it. Violante's brilliant loveliness
seemed yet more dazzling, and
Helen's fair gentle face yet more
winning. Neither had mixed much
with girls of her own age; each took
to the other at first sight. Violante,
as the less shy, began the conversation.</p>

<p>"You are his ward&mdash;Lord L'Estrange's?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you came with him from
Italy?"</p>

<p>"No, not exactly. But I have
been in Italy for some years."</p>

<p>"Ah! you regret&mdash;nay, I am foolish&mdash;you
return to your native land.
But the skies in Italy are so blue&mdash;here
it seems as if nature wanted
colours."</p>

<p>"Lord L'Estrange says that you
were very young when you left Italy;
you remember it well. He, too, prefers
Italy to England."</p>

<p>"He! Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Why impossible, fair sceptic?"
cried Harley, interrupting himself in
the midst of a speech to Jemima.</p>

<p>Violante had not dreamed that she
could be overheard&mdash;she was speaking
low; but, though visibly embarrassed,
she answered distinctly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Because in England there is the
noblest career for noble minds."</p>

<p>Harley was startled, and replied
with a slight sigh, "At your age I
should have said as you do. But this
England of ours is so crowded with
noble minds, that they only jostle
each other, and the career is one
cloud of dust."</p>

<p>"So, I have read, seems a battle
to the common soldier, but not to the
chief."</p>

<p>"You have read good descriptions
of battles, I see."</p>

<p>Mrs Riccabocca, who thought this
remark a taunt upon her daughter-in-law's
studies, hastened to Violante's
relief.</p>

<p>"Her papa made her read the history
of Italy, and I believe that is full
of battles."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harley.</span>&mdash;"All history is, and all
women are fond of war and of warriors.
I wonder why."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Violante</span>, (turning to Helen, and
in a very low voice, resolved that
Harley should not hear this time.)&mdash;"We
can guess why&mdash;can we not?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harley</span>, (hearing every word, as
if it had been spoken in St Paul's
Whispering Gallery.)&mdash;"If you can
guess, Helen, pray tell me."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>, (shaking her pretty head,
and answering with a livelier smile
than usual.)&mdash;"But I am not fond of
war and warriors."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harley</span> to Violante.&mdash;"Then I
must appeal at once to you, self-convicted
Bellona that you are. Is it
from the cruelty natural to the female
disposition?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Violante</span>, (with a sweet musical
laugh.)&mdash;"From two propensities still
more natural to it."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harley.</span>&mdash;"You puzzle me: what
can they be?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Violante.</span>&mdash;"Pity and admiration;
we pity the weak, and admire
the brave."</p>

<p>Harley inclined his head, and was
silent.</p>

<p>Lady Lansmere had suspended her
conversation with Riccabocca to listen
to this dialogue. "Charming!"
she cried. "You have explained
what has often perplexed me. Ah,
Harley, I am glad to see that your
satire is foiled: you have no reply to
that."</p>

<p>"No; I willingly own myself defeated-too
glad to claim the Signorina's
pity, since my cavalry sword
hangs on the wall, and I can have no
longer a professional pretence to her
admiration."</p>

<p>He then rose, and glanced towards
the window. "But I see a more
formidable disputant for my conqueror
to encounter is coming into the field&mdash;one
whose profession it is to substitute
some other romance for that of
camp and siege."</p>

<p>"Our friend Leonard," said Riccabocca,
turning his eye also towards
the window. "True; as Quevedo
says wittily, 'Ever since there has
been so great a demand for type,
there has been much less lead to spare
for cannon-balls.'"</p>

<p>Here Leonard entered. Harley had
sent Lady Lansmere's footman to him
with a note, that prepared him to
meet Helen. As he came into the
room, Harley took him by the hand,
and led him to Lady Lansmere.</p>

<p>"The friend of whom I spoke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Welcome him now for my sake, ever
after for his own;" and then, scarcely
allowing time for the Countess's elegant
and gracious response, he drew
Leonard towards Helen. "Children,"
said he, with a touching voice, that
thrilled through the hearts of both,
"go and seat yourselves yonder, and
talk together of the past. Signorina,
I invite you to renewed discussion
upon the abstruse metaphysical subject
you have started; let us see if
we cannot find gentler sources for
pity and admiration than war and
warriors." He took Violante aside
to the window. "You remember
that Leonard, in telling you his history
last night, spoke, you thought,
rather too briefly of the little girl who
had been his companion in the rudest
time of his trials. When you would
have questioned more, I interrupted
you, and said, 'You should see her
shortly, and question her yourself.'
And now what think you of Helen
Digby? Hush, speak low. But her
ears are not so sharp as mine."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Violante.</span>&mdash;"Ah! that is the fair
creature whom Leonard called his
child-angel? What a lovely innocent
face!&mdash;the angel is there still."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harley,</span> (pleased both at the
praise and with her who gave it.)&mdash;"You
think so; and you are right.
Helen is not communicative. But
fine natures are like fine poems&mdash;a
glance at the first two lines suffices
for a guess into the beauty that waits
you, if you read on."</p>

<p>Violante gazed on Leonard and
Helen as they sat apart. Leonard
was the speaker, Helen the listener;
and though the former had, in his narrative
the night before, been indeed
brief as to the episode in his life connected
with the orphan, enough had
been said to interest Violante in the
pathos of their former position towards
each other, and in the happiness
they must feel in their meeting
again&mdash;separated for years on the
wide sea of life, now both saved from
the storm and shipwreck. The tears
came into her eyes. "True," she
said very softly, "there is more here
to move pity and admiration than
in"&mdash;She paused.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harley.</span>&mdash;"Complete the sentence.
Are you ashamed to retract?
Fie on your pride and obstinacy."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Violante.</span>&mdash;"No; but even here
there have been war and heroism&mdash;the
war of genius with adversity, and
heroism in the comforter who shared
it and consoled. Ah! wherever pity
and admiration are both felt, something
nobler than mere sorrow must
have gone before: the heroic must
exist."</p>

<p>"Helen does not know what the
word heroic means," said Harley,
rather sadly; "you must teach her."</p>

<p>'Is it possible,' thought he as he
spoke, 'that a Randal Leslie could
have charmed this grand creature?
No 'Heroic' surely, in that sleek young
placeman.' "Your father," he said
aloud, and fixing his eyes on her face,
"sees much, he tells me, of a young
man, about Leonard's age, as to date;
but I never estimate the age of
men by the parish register; and I
should speak of that so-called young
man as a contemporary of my great-grandfather;&mdash;I
mean Mr Randal
Leslie. Do you like him?"</p>

<p>"Like him?" said Violante slowly,
and as if sounding her own mind.
"Like him&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Harley, with dry
and curt indignation.</p>

<p>"His visits seem to please my dear
father. Certainly I like him."</p>

<p>"Hum. He professes to like you,
I suppose?"</p>

<p>Violante laughed, unsuspiciously.
She had half a mind to reply, "Is
that so strange?" But her respect for
Harley stopped her. The words
would have seemed to her pert.</p>

<p>"I am told he is clever," resumed
Harley.</p>

<p>"O, certainly."</p>

<p>"And he is rather handsome. But
I like Leonard's face better."</p>

<p>"Better&mdash;that is not the word.
Leonard's face is as that of one who has
gazed so often upon heaven; and Mr
Leslie's&mdash;there is neither sunlight nor
starlight reflected there."</p>

<p>"My dear Violante!" exclaimed
Harley, overjoyed; and he pressed her
hand.</p>

<p>The blood rushed over the girl's
cheek and brow; her hand trembled
in his. But Harley's familiar exclamation
might have come from a
father's lips.</p>

<p>At this moment Helen softly approached
them, and looking timidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
into her guardian's face, said, "Leonard's
mother is with him: he asks
me to call and see her. May I?"</p>

<p>"May you! A pretty notion the
Signorina must form of your enslaved
state of pupilage, when she hears you
ask that question. Of course you
may."</p>

<p>"Will you take me there?"</p>

<p>Harley looked embarrassed. He
thought of the widow's agitation at
his name; of that desire to shun him,
which Leonard had confessed, and of
which he thought he divined the
cause. And, so divining, he too
shrank from such a meeting.</p>

<p>"Another time, then," said he, after
a pause.</p>

<p>Helen looked disappointed, but
said no more.</p>

<p>Violante was surprised at this ungracious
answer. She would have
blamed it as unfeeling in another.
But all that Harley did was right in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Cannot I go with Miss Digby?"
said she, "and my mother will go too.
We both know Mrs Fairfield. We
shall be so pleased to see her again."</p>

<p>"So be it," said Harley; "I will
wait here with your father till you
come back. O, as to my mother,
she will excuse the&mdash;excuse Madame
Riccabocca, and you too. See how
charmed she is with <em>your</em> father. I
must stay to watch over the conjugal
interests of <em>mine</em>."</p>

<p>But Mrs Riccabocca had too much
good old country breeding to leave
the Countess; and Harley was forced
himself to appeal to Lady Lansmere.
When he had explained the case in
point, the Countess rose and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"But I will call myself, with Miss
Digby."</p>

<p>"No," said Harley, gravely, but
in a whisper. "No&mdash;I would rather
not. I will explain later."</p>

<p>"Then," said the Countess aloud,
after a glance of surprise at her son,
"I must insist on your performing
this visit, my dear madam, and you,
Signorina. In truth, I have something
to say confidentially to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To me," interrupted Riccabocca.
"Ah, Madame la Comtesse, you restore
me to five-and-twenty. Go,
quick&mdash;O jealous and injured wife;
go, both of you, quick; and you, too,
Harley."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Lady Lansmere, in
the same tone, "Harley must stay,
for my design is not at present upon
destroying your matrimonial happiness,
whatever it may be later. It is
a design so innocent that my son
will be a partner in it."</p>

<p>Here the Countess put her lips to
Harley's ear, and whispered. He received
her communication in attentive
silence; but when she had done,
pressed her hand, and bowed his
head, as if in assent to a proposal.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the three ladies
and Leonard were on their road to
the neighbouring cottage.</p>

<p>Violante, with her usual delicate intuition,
thought that Leonard and
Helen must have much to say to each
other; and ignorant, as Leonard himself
was, of Helen's engagement to
Harley, began already, in the romance
natural to her age, to predict
for them happy and united days in
the future. So she took her stepmother's
arm, and left Helen and
Leonard to follow.</p>

<p>"I wonder," she said, musingly,
"how Miss Digby became Lord
L'Estrange's ward. I hope she is not
very rich, nor very high-born."</p>

<p>"La, my love," said the good
Jemima, "that is not like you; you
are not envious of her, poor girl?"</p>

<p>"Envious! Dear mamma, what a
word! But don't you think Leonard
and Miss Digby seem born for each
other? And then the recollections
of their childhood&mdash;the thoughts of
childhood are so deep, and its memories
so strangely soft!" The long lashes
drooped over Violante's musing eyes
as she spoke. "And therefore," she
said after a pause&mdash;"therefore I hoped
that Miss Digby might not be very
rich, nor very high-born."</p>

<p>"I understand you now, Violante,"
exclaimed Jemima, her own early
passion for match-making instantly
returning to her; "for as Leonard,
however clever and distinguished, is
still the son of Mark Fairfield the
carpenter, it would spoil all if Miss
Digby was, as you say, rich and high-born.
I agree with you&mdash;a very pretty
match&mdash;a very pretty match, indeed.
I wish dear Mrs Dale were here now&mdash;she
is so clever in settling such
matters."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Leonard and Helen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
walked side by side a few paces in the
rear. He had not offered her his
arm. They had been silent hitherto
since they left Riccabocca's house.</p>

<p>Helen now spoke first. In similar
cases it is generally the woman, be
she ever so timid, who does speak
first. And here Helen was the bolder;
for Leonard did not disguise from
himself the nature of his feelings, and
Helen was engaged to another; and
her pure heart was fortified by the
trust reposed in it.</p>

<p>"And have you ever heard more
of the good Dr Morgan, who had
powders against sorrow, and who
meant to be so kind to us&mdash;though,"
she added, colouring, "we did not
think so then?"</p>

<p>"He took my child-angel from me,"
said Leonard, with visible emotion;
"and if she had not returned, where
and what should I be now? But I
have forgiven him. No, I have never
met him since."</p>

<p>"And that terrible Mr Burley?"</p>

<p>"Poor, poor Burley! He, too, is
vanished out of my present life. I
have made many inquiries after him;
all I can hear is that he went abroad,
supposed as a correspondent to some
journal. I should like so much to see
him again, now that perhaps I could
help him as he helped me."</p>

<p>"<em>Helped</em> you&mdash;ah!"</p>

<p>Leonard smiled with a beating
heart, as he saw again the dear, prudent,
warning look, and involuntarily
drew closer to Helen. She seemed
more restored to him and to her former
self.</p>

<p>"Helped me much by his instructions;
more, perhaps, by his very
faults. You cannot guess, Helen&mdash;I
beg pardon, Miss Digby&mdash;but I forgot
that we are no longer children: you
cannot guess how much we men, and,
more than all perhaps, we writers,
whose task it is to unravel the web of
human actions, owe even to our own
past errors; and if we learned nothing
by the errors of others, we should be
dull indeed. We must know where
the roads divide, and have marked
where they lead to, before we can
erect our sign-posts; and books are
the sign-posts in human life."</p>

<p>"Books!&mdash;And I have not yet
read yours. And Lord L'Estrange
tells me you are famous now. Yet
you remember me still&mdash;the poor
orphan child, whom you first saw
weeping at her father's grave, and
with whom you burdened your own
young life, over-burdened already.
No, still call me Helen&mdash;you must
always be to me&mdash;a brother! Lord
L'Estrange feels <em>that</em>; he said so to
me when he told me that we were to
meet again. He is so generous, so
noble. Brother!" cried Helen, suddenly,
and extending her hand, with
a sweet but sublime look in her gentle
face&mdash;"brother, we will never forfeit
his esteem; we will both do our best
to repay him! Will we not&mdash;say so?"</p>

<p>Leonard felt overpowered by contending
and unanalysed emotions.
Touched almost to tears by the affectionate
address&mdash;thrilled by the hand
that pressed his own&mdash;and yet with a
vague fear, a consciousness that something
more than the words themselves
was implied&mdash;something that checked
all hope. And this word "brother,"
once so precious and so dear, why did
he shrink from it now?&mdash;why could he
not too say the sweet word "sister?"</p>

<p>"She is above me now and evermore!"
he thought, mournfully; and
the tones of his voice, when he spoke
again, were changed. The appeal to
renewed intimacy but made him more
distant; and to that appeal itself he
made no direct answer; for Mrs Riccabocca,
now turning round, and
pointing to the cottage which came in
view, with its picturesque gable-ends,
cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"But is that your house, Leonard?
I never saw anything so pretty."</p>

<p>"You do not remember it, then,"
said Leonard to Helen, in accents of
melancholy reproach&mdash;"there where
I saw you last! I doubted whether
to keep it exactly as it was, and I
said, 'No! the association is not
changed because we try to surround
it with whatever beauty we can
create; the dearer the association, the
more the Beautiful becomes to it natural.'
Perhaps you don't understand
this&mdash;perhaps it is only we poor poets
who do."</p>

<p>"I understand it," said Helen,
gently. She looked wistfully at the
cottage.</p>

<p>"So changed&mdash;I have so often pictured
it to myself&mdash;never, never like
this; yet I loved it, commonplace as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
it was to my recollection; and the
garret, and the tree in the carpenter's
yard."</p>

<p>She did not give these thoughts
utterance. And they now entered the
garden.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>Mrs Fairfield was a proud woman
when she received Mrs Riccabocca
and Violante in her grand house; for
a grand house to her was that cottage
to which her boy Lenny had brought
her home. Proud, indeed, ever was
Widow Fairfield; but she thought
then in her secret heart, that if ever
she could receive in the drawing-room
of that grand house the great Mrs
Hazeldean, who had so lectured her
for refusing to live any longer in the
humble tenement rented of the Squire,
the cup of human bless would be
filled, and she could contentedly
die of the pride of it. She did not
much notice Helen&mdash;her attention was
too absorbed by the ladies who renewed
their old acquaintance with
her, and she carried them all over the
house, yea, into the very kitchen;
and so, somehow or other, there was
a short time when Helen and Leonard
found themselves alone. It was in
the study. Helen had unconsciously
seated herself in Leonard's own chair,
and she was gazing with anxious and
wistful interest on the scattered papers,
looking so disorderly (though,
in truth, in that disorder there was
method, but method only known to
the owner,) and at the venerable well-worn
books, in all languages, lying
on the floor, on the chairs&mdash;anywhere.
I must confess that Helen's
first tidy womanlike idea was a great
desire to arrange the litter. "Poor
Leonard," she thought to herself&mdash;"the
rest of the house so neat, but no
one to take care of his own room and
of him!"</p>

<p>As if he divined her thought, Leonard
smiled, and said, "It would be
a cruel kindness to the spider, if the
gentlest hand in the world tried to set
its cobweb to rights."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span>&mdash;"You were not quite so
bad in the old days."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonard.</span>&mdash;"Yet even then, you
were obliged to take care of the
money. I have more books now, and
more money. My present housekeeper
lets me take care of the books, but she
is less indulgent as to the money."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>, (archly.)&mdash;"Are you as
absent as ever?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonard.</span>&mdash;"Much more so, I
fear. The habit is incorrigible. Miss
Digby&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span>&mdash;"Not Miss Digby&mdash;sister,
if you like."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonard</span>, (evading the word that
implied so forbidden an affinity.)&mdash;"Helen,
will you grant me a favour?
Your eyes and your smile say 'yes.'
Will you lay aside, for one minute,
your shawl and bonnet? What! can
you be surprised that I ask it? Can
you not understand that I wish for
one minute to think you are at home
again under this roof?"</p>

<p>Helen cast down her eyes, and
seemed troubled; then she raised
them, with a soft angelic candour in
their dovelike blue, and, as if in shelter
from all thoughts of more warm
affection, again murmured "<em>brother</em>,"
and did as he asked her.</p>

<p>So there she sate, amongst the
dull books, by his table, near the
open window&mdash;her fair hair parted on
her forehead&mdash;looking so good, so
calm, so happy! Leonard wondered
at his own self-command. His heart
yearned to her with such inexpressible
love&mdash;his lips so longed to murmur&mdash;"Ah,
as now so could it be
for ever! Is the home too mean?"
But that word "brother" was as a
talisman between her and him.</p>

<p>Yet she looked so at home&mdash;perhaps
so at home she felt!&mdash;more certainly
than she had yet learned to do in that
stiff stately house in which she was
soon to have a daughter's rights.
Was she suddenly made aware of
this&mdash;that she so suddenly arose&mdash;and
with a look of alarm and distress on
her face&mdash;</p>

<p>"But&mdash;we are keeping Lady Lansmere
too long," she said, falteringly.
"We must go now," and she hastily
took up her shawl and bonnet.</p>

<p>Just then Mrs Fairfield entered
with the visiters, and began making
excuses for inattention to Miss Digby,
whose identity with Leonard's child-angel
she had not yet learned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>Helen received these apologies with
her usual sweetness. "Nay," she
said, "your son and I are such old
friends, how could you stand on ceremony
with me?"</p>

<p>"Old friends!" Mrs Fairfield stared
amazed, and then surveyed the fair
speaker more curiously than she had
yet done. "Pretty nice spoken thing,"
thought the widow; "as nice spoken
as Miss Violante, and humbler-looking-like,&mdash;though,
as to dress,
I never see anything so elegant out
of a picter."</p>

<p>Helen now appropriated Mrs Riccabocca's
arm; and, after a kind leave-taking
with the widow, the ladies
returned towards Riccabocca's house.</p>

<p>Mrs Fairfield, however, ran after
them with Leonard's hat and gloves,
which he had forgotten.</p>

<p>"'Deed, boy," she said kindly, yet
scoldingly, "but there'd be no more
fine books, if the Lord had not
fixed your head on your shoulders.
You would not think it, marm,"
she added to Mrs Riccabocca, "but
sin' he has left you, he's not the 'cute
lad he was; very helpless at times,
marm!"</p>

<p>Helen could not resist turning
round, and looking at Leonard, with
a sly smile.</p>

<p>The widow saw the smile, and
catching Leonard by the arm, whispered,
"But, where before have you
seen that pretty young lady? Old
friends!"</p>

<p>"Ah, mother," said Leonard sadly,
"it is a long tale; you have heard
the beginning, who can guess the
end?"&mdash;and he escaped. But Helen
still leant on the arm of Mrs Riccabocca,
and, in the walk back, it
seemed to Leonard as if the winter
had resettled in the sky.</p>

<p>Yet he was by the side of Violante,
and she spoke to him with such praise,
of Helen! Alas! it is not always so
sweet as folks say, to hear the
praises of one we love. Sometimes
those praises seem to ask ironically,
"And what right hast thou to hope
because thou lovest? <em>All</em> love <em>her</em>."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p>No sooner had Lady Lansmere
found herself alone with Riccabocca
and Harley than she laid her hand
on the exile's arm, and, addressing
him by a title she had not before
given him, and from which he appeared
to shrink nervously, said&mdash;"Harley,
in bringing me to visit you,
was forced to reveal to me your incognito,
for I should have discovered
it. You may not remember me, in
spite of your gallantry. But I mixed
more in the world than I do now,
during your first visit to England,
and once sate next to you at dinner at
Carlton House. Nay, no compliments,
but listen to me. Harley tells me
you have cause for some alarm respecting
the designs of an audacious
and unprincipled&mdash;adventurer, I may
call him; for adventurers are of all
ranks. Suffer your daughter to come
to me, on a visit, as long as you
please. With me, at least, she will
be safe; and if you too, and the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, my dear madam," interrupted
Riccabocca, with great vivacity,
"your kindness overpowers me.
I thank you most gratefully for your
invitation to my child; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay," in his turn interrupted
Harley, "no buts. I was not aware of
my mother's intention when she entered
this room. But since she whispered
it to me, I have reflected on it, and
am convinced that it is but a prudent
precaution. Your retreat is known to
Mr Leslie&mdash;he is known to Peschiera.
Grant that no indiscretion of Mr
Leslie's betray the secret; still I
have reason to believe that the Count
guesses Randal's acquaintance with
you. Audley Egerton this morning
told me he had gathered that, not
from the young man himself, but from
questions put to himself by Madame
di Negra; and Peschiera might, and
would, set spies to track Leslie to
every house that he visits&mdash;might and
would, still more naturally, set spies
to track myself. Were this man an
Englishman, I should laugh at his
machinations; but he is an Italian, and
has been a conspirator. What he could
do I know not; but an assassin can
penetrate into a camp, and a traitor
can creep through closed walls to one's
hearth. With my mother, Violante
must be safe; that you cannot oppose.
And why not come yourself?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>Riccabocca had no reply to these
arguments, so far as they affected
Violante; indeed, they awakened the
almost superstitious terror with which
he regarded his enemy, and he consented
at once that Violante should
accept the invitation proffered. But
he refused it for himself and Jemima.</p>

<p>"To say truth," said he simply,
"I made a secret vow, on re-entering
England, that I would associate with
none who knew the rank I had formerly
held in my own land. I felt
that all my philosophy was needed,
to reconcile and habituate myself to
my altered circumstances. In order
to find in my present existence, however
humble, those blessings which
make all life noble&mdash;dignity and peace&mdash;it
was necessary for poor, weak
human nature, wholly to dismiss the
past. It would unsettle me sadly,
could I come to your house, renew
awhile, in your kindness and respect&mdash;nay,
in the very atmosphere of
your society&mdash;the sense of what I
have been; and then (should the
more than doubtful chance of recall
from my exile fail me) to awake, and
find myself for the rest of life&mdash;what
I am. And though, were I alone, I
might trust myself perhaps to the
danger&mdash;yet my wife: she is happy
and contented now; would she be
so, if you had once spoiled her for the
simple position of Dr Riccabocca's
wife? Should I not have to listen to
regrets, and hopes, and fears that
would prick sharp through my thin
cloak of philosophy? Even as it is,
since in a moment of weakness I
confided my secret to her, I have
had 'my rank' thrown at me&mdash;with
a careless hand, it is true&mdash;but
it hits hard, nevertheless. No
stone hurts like one taken from the
ruins of one's own home; and the
grander the home, why, the heavier
the stone! Protect, dear madam&mdash;protect
my daughter, since her father
doubts his own power to do so. But&mdash;ask
no more."</p>

<p>Riccabocca was immovable here.
And the matter was settled as he
decided, it being agreed that Violante
should be still styled but the
daughter of Dr Riccabocca.</p>

<p>"And now, one word more," said
Harley. "Do not confide to Mr
Leslie these arrangements; do not
let him know where Violante is
placed&mdash;at least, until I authorise
such confidence in him. It is sufficient
excuse, that it is no use to
know unless he called to see her, and
his movements, as I said before, may
be watched. You can give the same
reason to suspend his visits to yourself.
Suffer me, meanwhile, to mature
my judgment on this young man.
In the meanwhile, also, I think that
I shall have means of ascertaining
the real nature of Peschiera's schemes.
His sister has sought to know me;
I will give her the occasion. I have
heard some things of her in my last
residence abroad, which make me
believe that she cannot be wholly
the Count's tool in any schemes
nakedly villanous; that she has
some finer qualities in her than I
once supposed; and that she can be
won from his influence. It is a state
of war: we will carry it into the enemy's
camp. You will promise me,
then, to refrain from all farther confidence
to Mr Leslie."</p>

<p>"For the present, yes," said Riccabocca,
reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Do not even say that you have
seen me, unless he first tell you that
I am in England, and wish to learn
your residence. I will give him full
occasion to do so. Pish! don't hesitate;
you know your own proverb&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Boccha chiusa, ed occhio aperto<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Non fece mai nissun deserto.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">'The closed mouth and the open eye,'
&amp;c."</p>

<p>"That's very true," said the Doctor,
much struck. "Very true. '<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">In
boccha chiusa non c'entrano mosche.</i>'
One can't swallow flies if one keeps
one's mouth shut. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Corpo di Bacco!</i>
that's very true indeed."</p>

<p>Harley took aside the Italian.</p>

<p>"You see, if our hope of discovering
the lost packet, or if our belief in
the nature of its contents, be too sanguine,
still, in a few months it is
possible that Peschiera can have no
further designs on your daughter&mdash;possible
that a son may be born to
you, and Violante would cease to be
in danger, because she would cease
to be an heiress. Indeed, it may be
well to let Peschiera know this chance;
it would, at least, make him delay all
his plans while we are tracking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
document that may defeat them for
ever."</p>

<p>"No, no! for heaven's sake, no!"
exclaimed Riccabocca, pale as ashes.
"Not a word to him. I don't mean
to impute to him crimes of which he
may be innocent. But he meant to
take my life when I escaped the pursuit
of his hirelings in Italy. He did
not hesitate, in his avarice, to denounce
a kinsman; expose hundreds
to the sword, if resisting&mdash;to the dungeon,
if passive. Did he know that
my wife might bear me a son, how
can I tell that his designs might not
change into others still darker, and
more monstrous, than those he now
openly parades, though, after all, not
more infamous and vile. Would my
wife's life be safe? Not more difficult
to convey poison into my house,
than to steal my child from my hearth.
Don't despise me; but when I think
of my wife, my daughter, and that
man, my mind forsakes me: I am
one fear."</p>

<p>"Nay, this apprehension is too
exaggerated. We do not live in the
age of the Borgias. Could Peschiera
resort to the risks of a murder, it is
for yourself that you should fear."</p>

<p>"For myself!&mdash;I! I!" cried the
exile, raising his tall stature to its
full height. "Is it not enough degradation
to a man who has borne
the name of such ancestors, to fear
for those he loves! Fear for myself!
Is it you who ask if I am a coward?"</p>

<p>He recovered himself, as he felt
Harley's penitential and admiring
grasp of the hand.</p>

<p>"See," said he, turning to the
Countess with a melancholy smile,
"how even one hour of your society
destroys the habits of years. Dr Riccabocca
is talking of his ancestors!"</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p>Violante and Jemima were both
greatly surprised, as the reader may
suppose, when they heard, on their
return, the arrangements already
made for the former. The Countess
insisted on taking her at once, and
Riccabocca briefly said, "Certainly,
the sooner the better." Violante was
stunned and bewildered. Jemima
hastened to make up a little bundle
of things necessary, with many a
woman's sigh that the poor wardrobe
contained so few things befitting.
But among the clothes she slipped a
purse, containing the savings of
months, perhaps of years, and with it
a few affectionate lines, begging
Violante to ask the Countess to buy
her all that was proper for her
father's child. There is always something
hurried and uncomfortable in
the abrupt and unexpected withdrawal
of any member from a quiet
household. The small party broke
into still smaller knots. Violante
hung on her father, and listened
vaguely to his not very lucid explanations.
The Countess approached
Leonard, and, according to the usual
mode with persons of quality addressing
young authors, complimented
him highly on the books she had not
read, but which her son assured her
were so remarkable. She was a little
anxious to know where Harley had
met with Mr Oran, whom he called
his friend; but she was too high-bred
to inquire, or to express any wonder
that rank should be friends with
genius.</p>

<p>She took it for granted that they had
formed their acquaintance abroad.</p>

<p>Harley conversed with Helen.&mdash;"You
are not sorry that Violante is
coming to us? She will be just such
a companion for you as I could desire;
of your own years too."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>, (ingenuously.)&mdash;"It is hard
to think I am not younger than she
is."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harley.</span>&mdash;"Why, my dear
Helen?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span>&mdash;"She is so brilliant. She
talks so beautifully. And I&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harley.</span>&mdash;"And you want but the
habit of talking, to do justice to your
own beautiful thoughts."</p>

<p>Helen looked at him gratefully,
but shook her head. It was a common
trick of hers, and always when
she was praised.</p>

<p>At last the preparations were made&mdash;the
farewell was said. Violante
was in the carriage by Lady Lansmere's
side. Slowly moved on the
stately equipage with its four horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
and trim postilions, heraldic badges
on their shoulders, in the style rarely
seen in the neighbourhood of the
metropolis, and now fast vanishing
even amidst distant counties.</p>

<p>Riccabocca, Jemima, and Jackeymo
continued to gaze after it from the
gate.</p>

<p>"She is gone," said Jackeymo,
brushing his eyes with his coat-sleeve.
"But it is a load off one's mind."</p>

<p>"And another load on one's heart,"
murmured Riccabocca. "Don't cry,
Jemima; it may be bad for you, and
bad for <em>him</em> that is to come. It is
astonishing how the humours of the
mother may affect the unborn. I
should not like to have a son who has
a more than usual propensity to
tears."</p>

<p>The poor philosopher tried to
smile; but it was a bad attempt.
He went slowly in, and shut himself
up with his books. But he could not
read. His whole mind was unsettled.
And though, like all parents, he had
been anxious to rid himself of a beloved
daughter for life, now that she
was gone but for a while, a string
seemed broken in the Music of Home.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p>The evening of the same day, as
Egerton, who was to entertain a large
party at dinner, was changing his
dress, Harley walked into his room.</p>

<p>Egerton dismissed his valet by a
sign, and continued his toilet.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, my dear Harley, I
have only ten minutes to give you.
I expect one of the royal dukes, and
punctuality is the stern virtue of men
of business, and the graceful courtesy
of princes."</p>

<p>Harley had usually a jest for his
friend's aphorisms; but he had none
now. He laid his hand kindly on
Egerton's shoulder&mdash;"Before I speak
of my business, tell me how you are&mdash;better?"</p>

<p>"Better&mdash;nay, I am always well.
Pooh! I may look a little tired&mdash;years
of toil will tell on the countenance.
But that matters little&mdash;the period
of life has passed with me when
one cares how one looks in the glass."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Egerton completed his
dress, and came to the hearth, standing
there, erect and dignified as usual,
still far handsomer than many a
younger man, and with a form that
seemed to have ample vigour to support
for many a year the sad and
glorious burthen of power.</p>

<p>"So now to your business, Harley."</p>

<p>"In the first place, I want you to
present me, at the first opportunity,
to Madame di Negra. You say she
wished to know me."</p>

<p>"Are you serious?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, then, she receives this
evening. I did not mean to go; but
when my party breaks up"&mdash;</p>

<p>"You can call for me at 'The
Travellers.'&mdash;Do!</p>

<p>"Next&mdash;you knew Lady Jane
Horton better even than I did, at
least in the last year of her life."
Harley sighed, and Egerton turned
and stirred the fire.</p>

<p>"Pray, did you ever see at her
house, or hear her speak of, a Mrs
Bertram?"</p>

<p>"Of whom?" said Egerton, in a
hollow voice, his face still turned
towards the fire.</p>

<p>"A Mrs Bertram; but Heavens!
my dear fellow, what is the matter?
Are you ill?"</p>

<p>"A spasm at the heart&mdash;that is all&mdash;don't
ring&mdash;I shall be better presently&mdash;go
on talking. Mrs&mdash;&mdash;why
do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Why! I have hardly time to explain;
but I am, as I told you, resolved
on righting my old Italian friend, if
Heaven will help me, as it ever does
help the just when they bestir themselves;
and this Mrs Bertram is mixed
up in my friend's affairs."</p>

<p>"His! How is that possible?"</p>

<p>Harley rapidly and succinctly explained.
Audley listened attentively,
with his eyes fixed on the floor, and
still seeming to labour under great
difficulty of breathing.</p>

<p>At last he answered, "I remember
something of this Mrs&mdash;Mrs&mdash;Bertram.
But your inquiries after
her would be useless. I think I have
heard that she is long since dead;
nay, I am sure of it."</p>

<p>"Dead!&mdash;that is most unfortunate.
But do you know any of her relations
or friends? Can you suggest any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
mode of tracing this packet, if it came
to her hands?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And Lady Jane had scarcely
any friend that I remember, except
my mother, and she knows nothing
of this Mrs Bertram. How
unlucky! I think I shall advertise.
Yet, no. I could only distinguish
this Mrs Bertram from any other of
the same name, by stating with
whom she had gone abroad, and that
would catch the attention of Peschiera,
and set him to counterwork us."</p>

<p>"And what avails it?" said Egerton.
"She whom you seek is no
more&mdash;no more!" He paused, and
went on rapidly&mdash;"The packet did not
arrive in England till years after her
death&mdash;was no doubt returned to the
post-office&mdash;is destroyed long ago."</p>

<p>Harley looked very much disappointed.
Egerton went on in a sort
of set mechanical voice, as if not
thinking of what he said, but speaking
from the dry practical mode of reasoning
which was habitual to him, and
by which the man of the world
destroys the hopes of an enthusiast.
Then starting up at the sound of the
first thundering knock at the street
door, he said, "Hark! you must
excuse me."</p>

<p>"I leave you, my dear Audley.
Are you better now?"</p>

<p>"Much, much&mdash;quite well. I will
call for you,&mdash;probably between
eleven and twelve."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p>If any one could be more surprised
at seeing Lord L'Estrange at the house
of Madame di Negra that evening
than the fair hostess herself, it was
Randal Leslie. Something instinctively
told him that this visit threatened
interference with whatever might
be his ultimate projects in regard to
Riccabocca and Violante. But Randal
Leslie was not one of those who
shrink from an intellectual combat.
On the contrary, he was too confident
of his powers of intrigue, not to take
a delight in their exercise. He could
not conceive that the indolent Harley
could be a match for his own restless
activity and dogged perseverance.
But in a very few moments fear crept
on him. No man of his day could
produce a more brilliant effect than
Lord L'Estrange, when he deigned to
desire it. Without much pretence to
that personal beauty which strikes at
first sight, he still retained all the
charm of countenance, and all the
grace of manner, which had made
him in boyhood the spoiled darling of
society. Madame di Negra had collected
but a small circle round her,
still it was of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</i> of the great
world; not, indeed, those more precise
and reserved <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dames du chateau</i>,
whom the lighter and easier of the
fair dispensers of fashion ridicule as
prudes; but, nevertheless, ladies
were there, as unblemished in reputation
as high in rank; flirts and
coquettes, perhaps&mdash;nothing more; in
short, "charming women"&mdash;the gay
butterflies that hover over the stiff
parterre. And there were ambassadors
and ministers, and wits and
brilliant debaters, and first-rate
dandies, (dandies, when first-rate,
are generally very agreeable men.)
Amongst all these various persons,
Harley, so long a stranger to the
London world, seemed to make himself
at home with the ease of an
Alcibiades. Many of the less juvenile
ladies remembered him, and rushed
to claim his acquaintance, with nods,
and becks, and wreathed smiles. He
had ready compliment for each.
And few indeed were there, men or
women, for whom Harley L'Estrange
had not appropriate attraction. Distinguished
reputation as soldier and
scholar, for the grave; whim and
pleasantry for the gay; novelty for
the sated; and for the more vulgar
natures, was he not Lord L'Estrange,
unmarried, heir to an ancient earldom,
and some fifty thousands a-year?</p>

<p>Not till he had succeeded in the
general effect&mdash;which, it must be
owned, he did his best to create&mdash;did
Harley seriously and especially
devote himself to his hostess. And
then he seated himself by her side;
and, as if in compliment to both, less
pressing admirers insensibly slipped
away and edged off.</p>

<p>Frank Hazeldean was the last to
quit his ground behind Madame di
Negra's chair; but when he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
that the two began to talk in Italian,
and he could not understand a word
they said, he too&mdash;fancying, poor fellow,
that he looked foolish, and
cursing his Eton education that had
neglected, for languages spoken by
the dead, of which he had learned
little, those still in use among the
living, of which he had learned
nought&mdash;retreated towards Randal,
and asked wistfully, "Pray, what age
should you say L'Estrange was? He
must be devilish old, in spite of his
looks. Why, he was at Waterloo!"</p>

<p>"He is young enough to be a
terrible rival," answered Randal,
with artful truth.</p>

<p>Frank turned pale, and began to meditate
dreadful bloodthirsty thoughts,
of which hair-triggers and Lord's
Cricket-ground formed the staple.</p>

<p>Certainly there was apparent
ground for a lover's jealousy. For
Harley and Beatrice now conversed
in a low tone, and Beatrice seemed
agitated, and Harley earnest. Randal
himself grew more and more perplexed.
Was Lord L'Estrange really
enamoured of the Marchesa? If so,
farewell to all hopes of Frank's marriage
with her! Or was he merely
playing a part in Riccabocca's interest;
pretending to be the lover, in
order to obtain an influence over her
mind, rule her through her ambition,
and secure an ally against her
brother? Was this <em>finesse</em> compatible
with Randal's notions of Harley's
character? Was it consistent with
that chivalric and soldierly spirit of
honour which the frank nobleman
affected, to make love to a woman in
mere <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruse de guerre</i>? Could mere
friendship for Riccabocca be a sufficient
inducement to a man, who,
whatever his weaknesses or his
errors, seemed to wear on his very
forehead a soul above deceit, to stoop
to paltry means, even for a worthy
end? At this question, a new
thought flashed upon Randal&mdash;might
not Lord L'Estrange have speculated
himself upon winning Violante?&mdash;would
not that account for all the
exertions he had made on behalf of
her inheritance at the court of Vienna&mdash;exertions
of which Peschiera and
Beatrice had both complained? Those
objections which the Austrian government
might take to Violante's marriage
with some obscure Englishman
would probably not exist against a
man like Harley L'Estrange, whose
family not only belonged to the
highest aristocracy of England, but
had always supported opinions in
vogue amongst the leading governments
of Europe. Harley himself, it
is true, had never taken part in
politics, but his notions were, no
doubt, those of a high-born soldier,
who had fought, in alliance with
Austria, for the restoration of the
Bourbons. And this immense wealth&mdash;which
Violante might lose, if she
married one like Randal himself&mdash;her
marriage with the heir of the
Lansmeres might actually tend only
to secure. Could Harley, with all his
own expectations, be indifferent to
such a prize?&mdash;and no doubt he had
learned Violante's rare beauty in his
correspondence with Riccabocca.</p>

<p>Thus considered, it seemed natural
to Randal's estimate of human nature,
that Harley's more prudish scruples
of honour, as regards what is due to
women, could not resist a temptation
so strong. Mere friendship was not
a motive powerful enough to shake
them, but ambition was.</p>

<p>While Randal was thus cogitating,
Frank thus suffering, and many a
whisper, in comment on the evident
flirtation between the beautiful hostess
and the accomplished guest, reached
the ears both of the brooding schemer
and the jealous lover, the conversation
between the two objects of remark
and gossip had taken a new turn.
Indeed, Beatrice had made an effort
to change it.</p>

<p>"It is long, my lord," said she,
still speaking Italian, "since I have
heard sentiments like those you address
to me; and if I do not feel myself
wholly unworthy of them, it is
from the pleasure I have felt in reading
sentiments equally foreign to the
language of the world in which I live."
She took a book from the table as she
spoke: "Have you seen this work?"</p>

<p>Harley glanced at the title-page.
"To be sure I have, and I know the
author."</p>

<p>"I envy you that honour. I should
so like also to know one who has discovered
to me deeps in my own heart
which I had never explored."</p>

<p>"Charming Marchesa, if the book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
has done this, believe me that I have
paid you no false compliment&mdash;formed
no overflattering estimate of your
nature; for the charm of the work
is but in its simple appeal to good
and generous emotions, and it can
charm none in whom those emotions
exist not!"</p>

<p>"Nay, that cannot be true, or
why is it so popular?"</p>

<p>"Because good and generous emotions
are more common to the human
heart than we are aware of till the
appeal comes."</p>

<p>"Don't ask me to think that! I
have found the world so base."</p>

<p>"Pardon me a rude question; but
what do you know of the world?"</p>

<p>Beatrice looked first in surprise
at Harley, then glanced round the
room with significant irony.</p>

<p>"As I thought; you call this little
room 'the world.' Be it so. I will
venture to say, that if the people in
this room were suddenly converted
into an audience before a stage, and
you were as consummate in the actor's
art as you are in all others that
please and command&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"And were to deliver a speech full
of sordid and base sentiments, you
would be hissed. But let any other
woman, with half your powers, arise
and utter sentiments sweet and
womanly, or honest and lofty&mdash;and
applause would flow from every lip,
and tears rush to many a worldly
eye. The true proof of the inherent
nobleness of our common nature is in
the sympathy it betrays with what is
noble wherever crowds are collected.
Never believe the world is base;&mdash;if
it were so, no society could hold together
for a day. But you would
know the author of this book? I will
bring him to you."</p>

<p>"Do."</p>

<p>"And now," said Harley rising, and
with his candid winning smile, "do
you think we shall ever be friends?"</p>

<p>"You have startled me so, that I
can scarcely answer. But why would
you be friends with me?"</p>

<p>"Because you need a friend. You
have none?"</p>

<p>"Strange flatterer!" said Beatrice,
smiling, though very sadly; and looking
up, her eye caught Randal's.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said Harley, "you are
too penetrating to believe that you
inspire friendship <em>there</em>. Ah, do you
suppose that, all the while I have
been conversing with you, I have not
noticed the watchful gaze of Mr
Randal Leslie? What tie can possibly
connect you together I know
not yet; but I soon shall."</p>

<p>"Indeed! you talk like one of
the old Council of Venice. You try
hard to make me fear you," said
Beatrice, seeking to escape from the
graver kind of impression Harley had
made on her, by the affectation, partly
of coquetry, partly of levity.</p>

<p>"And I," said L'Estrange calmly,
"tell you already, that I fear you
no more." He bowed, and passed
through the crowd to rejoin Audley,
who was seated in a corner, whispering
with some of his political
colleagues. Before Harley reached
the minister, he found himself close
to Randal and young Hazeldean.</p>

<p>He bowed to the first, and extended
his hand to the last. Randal felt the
distinction, and his sullen, bitter
pride was deeply galled&mdash;a feeling of
hate towards Harley passed into his
mind. He was pleased to see the
cold hesitation with which Frank just
touched the hand offered to him.
But Randal had not been the only
person whose watch upon Beatrice
the keen-eyed Harley had noticed.
Harley had seen the angry looks of
Frank Hazeldean, and divined the
cause. So he smiled forgivingly at
the slight he had received.</p>

<p>"You are like me, Mr Hazeldean,"
said he. "You think something of
the heart should go with all courtesy
that bespeaks friendship&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"The hand of Douglas is his own."
</p>

<p>Here Harley drew aside Randal.
"Mr Leslie, a word with you. If I
wished to know the retreat of Dr
Riccabocca, in order to render him a
great service, would you confide to
me that secret?"</p>

<p>"That woman has let out her suspicions
that I know the exile's retreat,"
thought Randal; and with rare
presence of mind, he replied at once&mdash;</p>

<p>"My Lord, yonder stands a connection
of Dr Riccabocca's. Mr Hazeldean
is surely the person to whom
you should address this inquiry."</p>

<p>"Not so, Mr Leslie; for I suspect
that he cannot answer it, and that
you can. Well, I will ask something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
that it seems to me you may grant
without hesitation. Should you see
Dr Riccabocca, tell him that I am in
England, and so leave it to him to
communicate with me or not; but
perhaps you have already done so?"</p>

<p>"Lord L'Estrange," said Randal,
bowing low, with pointed formality,
"excuse me if I decline either to
disclaim or acquiesce in the knowledge
you impute to me. If I am
acquainted with any secret intrusted
to me by Dr Riccabocca, it is for me
to use my own discretion how best to
guard it. And for the rest, after
the Scotch earl, whose words your
lordship has quoted, refused to touch
the hand of Marmion, Douglas could
scarcely have called him back in order
to give him&mdash;a message!"</p>

<p>Harley was not prepared for this
tone in Mr Egerton's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</i>, and
his own gallant nature was rather
pleased than irritated by a haughtiness
that at least seemed to bespeak
independence of spirit. Nevertheless,
L'Estrange's suspicions of Randal
were too strong to be easily set aside,
and therefore he replied, civilly, but
with covert taunt&mdash;</p>

<p>"I submit to your rebuke, Mr Leslie,
though I meant not the offence
you would ascribe to me. I regret
my unlucky quotation yet the more,
since the wit of your retort has obliged
you to identify yourself with Marmion,
who, though a clever and brave fellow,
was an uncommonly&mdash;tricky one."
And so Harley, certainly having the
best of it, moved on, and joining
Egerton, in a few minutes more both
left the room.</p>

<p>"What was L'Estrange saying to
you?" asked Frank. "Something
about Beatrice I am sure."</p>

<p>"No; only quoting poetry."</p>

<p>"Then what made you look so
angry, my dear fellow? I know it
was your kind feeling for me. As
you say, he is a formidable rival.
But that can't be his own hair. Do
you think he wears a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toupet</i>? I am
sure he was praising Beatrice. He is
evidently very much smitten with her.
But I don't think she is a woman to be
caught by <em>mere</em> rank and fortune!
Do you? Why can't you speak?"</p>

<p>"If you do not get her consent
soon, I think she is lost to you," said
Randal slowly; and, before Frank
could recover his dismay, glided from
the house.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p>Violante's first evening at the Lansmeres,
had seemed happier to her than
the first evening, under the same roof,
had done to Helen. True that she
missed her father much&mdash;Jemima
somewhat; but she so identified her
father's cause with Harley, that she
had a sort of vague feeling that it was
to promote that cause that she was on
this visit to Harley's parents. And
the Countess, it must be owned, was
more emphatically cordial to her than
she had ever yet been to Captain
Digby's orphan. But perhaps the
real difference in the heart of either
girl was this, that Helen felt awe of
Lady Lansmere, and Violante felt
only love for Lord L'Estrange's
mother. Violante, too, was one of
those persons whom a reserved and
formal person, like the Countess,
"can get on with," as the phrase
goes. Not so poor little Helen&mdash;so
shy herself, and so hard to coax into
more than gentle monosyllables. And
Lady Lansmere's favourite talk was
always of Harley. Helen had listened
to such talk with respect and interest.
Violante listened to it with inquisitive
eagerness&mdash;with blushing delight. The
mother's heart noticed the distinction
between the two, and no wonder that
that heart moved more to Violante
than to Helen. Lord Lansmere, too,
like most gentlemen of his age,
clumped all young ladies together, as
a harmless, amiable, but singularly
stupid class of the genus-Petticoat,
meant to look pretty, play the piano,
and talk to each other about frocks
and sweethearts. Therefore this animated
dazzling creature, with her
infinite variety of look and play of
mind, took him by surprise, charmed
him into attention, and warmed him
into gallantry. Helen sate in her
quiet corner, at her work, sometimes
listening with almost mournful, though
certainly unenvious, admiration at
Violante's vivid, yet ever unconscious,
eloquence of word and thought&mdash;sometimes
plunged deep into her own secret
meditations. And all the while the
work went on the same, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
small noiseless fingers. This was one
of Helen's habits that irritated the
nerves of Lady Lansmere. She despised
young ladies who were fond of
work. She did not comprehend how
often it is the resource of the sweet
womanly mind, not from want of
thought, but from the silence and the
depth of it. Violante was surprised,
and perhaps disappointed, that Harley
had left the house before dinner, and
did not return all the evening. But
Lady Lansmere, in making excuse
for his absence, on the plea of engagements,
found so good an opportunity
to talk of his ways in general&mdash;of his
rare promise in boyhood&mdash;of her regret
at the inaction of his maturity&mdash;of
her hope to see him yet do justice to
his natural powers, that Violante
almost ceased to miss him.</p>

<p>And when Lady Lansmere conducted
her to her room, and, kissing her
cheek tenderly, said, "But you are
just the person Harley admires&mdash;just
the person to rouse him from melancholy
dreams, of which his wild humours
are now but the vain disguise"&mdash;Violante
crossed her arms on her
bosom, and her bright eyes, deepened
into tenderness, seemed to ask, "He
melancholy&mdash;and why?"</p>

<p>On leaving Violante's room, Lady
Lansmere paused before the door of
Helen's; and, after musing a little
while, entered softly.</p>

<p>Helen had dismissed her maid, and,
at the moment Lady Lansmere entered,
she was kneeling at the foot of the bed,
her hands clasped before her face.</p>

<p>Her form, thus seen, looked so
youthful and child-like&mdash;the attitude
itself was so holy and so touching,
that the proud and cold expression on
Lady Lansmere's face changed. She
shaded the light involuntarily, and
seated herself in silence, that she
might not disturb the act of prayer.</p>

<p>When Helen rose, she was startled
to see the Countess seated by the
fire; and hastily drew her hand across
her eyes. She had been weeping.</p>

<p>Lady Lansmere did not, however,
turn to observe those traces of tears,
which Helen feared were too visible.
The Countess was too absorbed in her
own thoughts; and as Helen timidly
approached, she said&mdash;still with her
eyes on the clear low fire&mdash;"I beg
your pardon, Miss Digby, for my intrusion;
but my son has left it to me
to prepare Lord Lansmere to learn the
offer you have done Harley the honour
to accept. I have not yet spoken to
my lord; it may be days before I find
a fitting occasion to do so; meanwhile,
I feel assured that your sense of propriety
will make you agree with me that
it is due to Lord L'Estrange's father,
that strangers should not learn arrangements
of such moment in his family,
before his own consent be obtained."</p>

<p>Here the Countess came to a full
pause; and poor Helen, finding herself
called upon for some reply to this
chilling speech, stammered out, scarce
audibly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Certainly, madam, I never dreamed
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is right, my dear," interrupted
Lady Lansmere, rising suddenly, and
as if greatly relieved. "I could not
doubt your superiority to ordinary girls
of your age, with whom these matters
are never secret for a moment. Therefore,
of course, you will not mention,
at present, what has passed between
you and Harley, to any of the friends
with whom you may correspond."</p>

<p>"I have no correspondents&mdash;no
friends, Lady Lansmere," said Helen
deprecatingly, and trying hard not to
cry.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to hear it, my
dear; young ladies never should have.
Friends, especially friends who correspond,
are the worst enemies they can
have. Good night, Miss Digby. I need
not add, by the way, that, though we
are bound to show all kindness to this
young Italian lady, still she is wholly
unconnected with our family; and you
will be as prudent with her as you
would have been with your correspondents&mdash;had
you had the misfortune
to have any."</p>

<p>Lady Lansmere said the last words
with a smile, and pressed a reluctant
kiss (the stepmother's kiss) on Helen's
bended brow. She then left the
room, and Helen sate on the seat
vacated by the stately unloving form,
and again covered her face with her
hands, and again wept. But when she
rose at last, and the light fell upon
her face, that soft face was sad indeed,
but serene&mdash;serene, as if with some
inward sense of duty&mdash;sad, as with
the resignation which accepts patience
instead of hope.</p>

<h2><a name="ENGLISH_ADMINISTRATIONS6" id="ENGLISH_ADMINISTRATIONS6">ENGLISH ADMINISTRATIONS.</a><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h2>


<p>The last century was the era of
monarchs. The <em>people</em> had not yet
formed a visible object. They were
the counters at the table of the great
gamesters of the day. In England,
which had since the Reformation
always advanced before the age, the
people had started into substantial
existence. It was impossible totally
to overlook a power which had subverted
one Constitution, and erected
another&mdash;which had dethroned one
dynasty, and enthroned another&mdash;which
had begun its existence under
theories of divine right, and signalised
the maturity of its generation
by establishing the most perfect
national freedom which man had
ever seen.</p>

<p>But, in continental Europe, the
people formed no more an object, in
the general polity of nations, than
a submarine mountain takes its place
in a map of the ocean. It had an
existence, but no recognition; it
had a place, but the ship of the State
passed over it without casting the
lead or shifting a sail. The government
of all foreign nations existed
only in the Council Chamber. The
king was at once the author and the
agent of all measures; the decrees
of the administration were as mysterious,
as inscrutable, and as unexpected,
as Oracles. Men saw nothing
in the political world but kingdoms&mdash;masses
of power&mdash;revolving before
the eye of the politician and the
philosopher, as the planets revolved,
with irresistible force, with vast and
various splendour, but by laws as
much beyond human dispute as the
Laws of Nature.</p>

<p>The maxim which in our day is
felt to contain the consummation of
despotism, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Etat&mdash;c'est moi</i>, was once
the <em>motto</em> of every throne, the essential
character of dominion, the crown
jewel, the substance of the sceptre.
Whether that maxim is to be revived&mdash;whether
the struggle between popular
power and the throne is once
more to be tried&mdash;whether the monarchies
of Europe, unwarned by
the rents already made in their
ramparts by the comparatively slight
incursions of the popular surge, are
prepared to defy the ocean in its
strength, must be left to the future.</p>

<p>But there can be no doubt in the
prediction, that whenever the ultimate
conflict arrives, it will be tremendous;
it will shake all the old
barriers of power, and either cover
society with ruin, or sweep away
the ruin itself, for a total renovation.</p>

<p>It is difficult to touch upon this
subject without some reference to
that country which, for the last fifty
years, has gone the whole round
of revolution&mdash;has lived in an atmosphere
of fiery vapours&mdash;has been
acclimated to epidemics of overthrow&mdash;and
reckons her years by
the flight of monarchs, the fabrication
of hollow governments, and the
crush of constitutions.</p>

<p>France seems resolved on making
the dreadful experiment of Despotism.
It failed before, and its failure consigned
the Imperial experimentalist
to a fate so singular and so condign,
as to seem a direct punishment from
Providence for daring to counteract
its purposes in the progress of man.
With his successor to his principles,
the experiment is but beginning.
How will it end? He has invoked a
spirit that had been laid these thirty
years. Whether, like the magicians
of old, he must find employment for
the demon, under the penalty of
being in his grasp, or he is finally
to evade the bond, no man within
memory has placed himself and his
country in a more trying and threatening
dilemma. If he attempts to
make war his policy, he will be
guilty of every drop of blood shed
in the field. If he attempts to re-establish
despotism, he has the
warning of St Helena before his
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>But, without conjecturing the personal
fate of this man of power,
nothing can be clearer than the fact
that he has placed himself in a
position to mould the fate of Europe
for a century to come. If he shall
succeed in concentrating all national
power in himself, the example is
sure not to be lost upon kings.
The insults which characterised the
triumphs of the mob in the late
Continental tumults&mdash;the remembrances
which must rankle in the
hearts of all Continental governments&mdash;the
revenge, which is the
natural passion of arbitrary power&mdash;and
even the rational alarm at the
possible return of the popular excesses,
must make all foreign princes
partial to the revival of Despotism.</p>

<p>This hour is a <em>Crisis</em>. Principles
are on their trial; the antagonists
are in the field; and the first shock
may decide, for a long period, the
victory of bold measures over impassioned
men, and of unlimited
might over confused, but daring, and
defeated, but obstinate, right&mdash;a contest
which will never wholly cease
henceforth, and which, in its continuance,
may shatter the whole
frame of society.</p>

<p>How far this great political change
in the most influential of kingdoms
may be but the indication of a new
course of Providence&mdash;how far it
may be connected with those new
and singular means and powers of
nature and of mechanism which,
in our time, have been assigned to
man&mdash;how far it may be, in politics,
a corresponding phase to the railroad,
the electric telegraph, and the
discoveries of gold in the ends of
the earth&mdash;can be only a matter of
conjecture; but while we are convinced
that Providence does nothing
without system, and does nothing
in vain, we cannot altogether suppress
the feeling, that an Era of
<em>Revelations</em> in government, science,
and society, has begun.</p>

<p>But it must be acknowledged that
the monarchs of the last century bore
their honours well. They were all
bold, brave, and intelligent. Whether
in the right or the wrong, they
showed decision&mdash;the first qualification
for the government of kingdoms.
Some were of remarkable
intellectual power, and none, with
slight exceptions, were inferior to
the weight of the diadem. The age
which reckoned among its sovereigns,
Frederic II. of Prussia,
Maria Theresa of Germany, the Emperor
Joseph, the Czarina Catherine,
and, in its earlier portion, Louis
XIV. and William III., could not
be regarded as destitute of minds
equal to the conduct of affairs in
perhaps the most complicated, struggling,
and difficult period of Europe
before the French Revolution.</p>

<p>The reign of George II. formed a
strong contrast to those of the Continental
sovereigns: their difficulties
arose from war&mdash;his from peace;
their combats in the field were
scarcely less anxious than his in the
cabinet. The conclusion was different;
the successes and failure of
the foreign monarch equally wasted
the blood and treasure of Europe;
the struggles of the British king
issued in larger accessions to liberty,
and to the power of that body which
is politically called the <em>people</em>.</p>

<p>George II. was a stern and stubborn
man, possessed of considerable
ability, but unpopular in its application;
unimpassioned, but ambitious
of fame; longing to figure in war,
but compelled by the nation to
peace; uneasy in England, and never
happy but in Hanover, from which
he imported his prejudices and his
favourites, his politics and his household;
fond of power, but capable of
complying with the public will; and
retaining all the feelings of a German
Elector, yet respectful to the laws
of a limited monarchy. Whatever
were the morals of the court, he
never sought to make them the
fashion in England; and whatever
might be his own sense of decorum,
he governed his people with dignity,
dying at the age of seventy-seven;
and, after a reign of thirty-four
years, he was, if not loved, regretted
by the empire.</p>

<p>The volumes which have recalled
us to this subject consist of the
correspondence of George Grenville,
Lord Temple, and their chief contemporaries&mdash;among
the rest, the
celebrated Earl of Chatham. It
extends from 1742 to the tenth year
of George III., and is peculiarly important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
in its references to the last
seventeen years of that period.</p>

<p>It has long been the custom of the
leading English families in public
life to preserve the documents connected
with their career. This habit
exists, perhaps, to a greater extent
in England than in any other country,
from the superior nature of
public character, from the frequency
of public investigation, from the
severity of public judgment, and,
as the general result, from the importance
of having a ready defence
of the statesman's reputation against
the casual charge as well as the
studied libel.</p>

<p>The history of the present <em>deposit</em>
may be briefly told. Earl Temple's
papers were always kept at Stowe, the
well-known and superb mansion of the
Buckingham family. A considerable
portion of Mr Grenville's correspondence,
preserved at Wotton, was
brought to Stowe, and arranged
with that of Earl Temple, and the
remainder was discovered by the
editor, in a large chest at Buckingham
House, which had remained
unopened since it was brought
there. The whole of these papers
were rearranged by the late Duke,
with the assistance of the editor,
(then librarian at Stowe,) but with
the ducal wish that they should
not be published before the death
of his uncle, the Right Hon. Thomas
Grenville. The latter, however, surviving
the Duke seven years, the
publication was retarded till, by the
present Duke, it was committed to
the hands of the editor, in conformity
with the intention of his
father.</p>

<p>In England in the last century there
were <em>castes</em> as marked as in India:
there was a military caste, a class of
society in which the generality of the
military commissions, and all the
leading employments of the court,
went; there was also a political <em>caste</em>,
a class in which all the great offices
of administration went, as regularly
as the night succeeded the day, and
in which any deviation from the
routine, any appointment of any individual
<em>not</em> in the muster-roll of the
aristocracy, would probably have
been considered as a deviation from
the law of nature. In this condition
of things, men of other classes had no
imaginable chance of prominent office
on their own account. Their only
hope must be in attaching themselves
to some of those "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dii majorum gentium</i>"&mdash;those
sons of fortune, those
hereditary possessors of high positions,
those natural rulers of the
powers and the privileges of political
high life. The government, in consequence,
was an Oligarchy under the
name of a monarchy, and the authority
of the Crown was merged in the
actual authority of the political connection.</p>

<p>The monarch had, undoubtedly, the
right to choose, but it was the right
to choose between submitting to the
captain of the ship and going over the
side. He might appoint his cabinet,
but he must appoint it from the men
whom the political class offered; he
could not stray into the world for a
better selection; he could not follow
the man of talents, or the man of
integrity, into the less nobly born and
less dexterously combined orders of
society: <em>there</em> stood the aristocratic
recruits for his government, and unless
he took them as they were, he
was a general without an army.
The advantages and disadvantages of
this system were equally conspicuous.
On the one view, ministers were not
the creatures of place; they had personal
characters to lose, their principles
were publicly known, they
were not dependent on the emoluments
of office, nor thus had grown
up through a succession of minor employments
into places of distinction,
the most ill-omened education for
public men; they were not adventurers,
they brought with them an
accession of family influence, which
raised them beyond the great temptation
of <em>new</em> men&mdash;that of courting the
populace; and as the natural result
of their birth, connections, and intercourse
with men of a high class of
society, they acted under a higher
sense of dignity, and their public acts
were more generally marked with a
fearless, open, and generous stamp.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the evils were
of some moment in the monopoly of
power in turning the State into a corporation,
in the restriction on the
rising ability of the humbler conditions
of life, to the loss of doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
much vigorous and original aid to the
public councils, in the jealousy which
that restriction naturally created in
men who felt their talents, and in the
consequent difficulties produced by
the direction of those talents to party,
as the only means of claiming justice
for themselves. This was continually
felt in the political tumults of England
for the last fifty years of the century,
and it was eminently experienced in
Ireland, where every rising barrister
instantly took the side of Opposition,
and where even his attainment of
office was felt as a stimulant and a
bribe for new assaults on the Government:
like buying off an invasion, the
purchase was only a proclamation for
a new march against the cabinet.</p>

<p>The Grenvilles were of the political
<em>caste</em>, and for two-thirds of a century
there was no political good fortune in
which a Grenville was not sure to
share, if on the ministerial side&mdash;nor
measure of opposition in which a
Grenville was not sure to be busy,
until the change came round, and the
bustling patriot was transformed into
the complacent placeman.</p>

<p>The <em>public</em> origin of this family was
derived from Richard Temple of
Wotton, by his marriage with the
sister of Lord Cobham of Stowe,
whom she succeeded, by the title of
Countess Temple, in 1759. The eldest
son of this marriage was Richard,
Earl Temple, born in 1711. The
second son was George Grenville, the
minister, born in 1712. The next
brother was James Grenville, a Lord
of Trade, Deputy-paymaster of the
Forces, and Cofferer of the Household.
The third was Henry Grenville, successively
governor of Barbadoes, ambassador
to Constantinople, and a
Commissioner of Customs. The fourth
was Thomas Grenville, a captain in
the navy, who was unfortunately
killed in action.</p>

<p>George Grenville, the minister, had
three sons, equally heirs of official
fortune;&mdash;George, who succeeded to
the earldom of Temple, and afterwards
obtained the marquisate of
Buckingham; Thomas Grenville,
who, after filling several lucrative
offices, died lately, and honourably
left his fine library to the nation.
The youngest son was the late Lord
Grenville, the coadjutor of William
Pitt. The connection with that illustrious
statesmen was formed through
the marriage of Lady Hester Grenville,
the sister of the first Earl
Temple, with Pitt, afterwards Earl
of Chatham, and the father of William
Pitt. The present Duke of Buckingham
is the great-grandson of George
Grenville.</p>

<p>As George Grenville forms the
principal personage of these volumes,
a sketch of his progress to power may
be given. Educated at Eton and
Christ-Church, he was intended for
the bar, but, at the suggestion of his
relative, Lord Cobham, he soon determined
on a political career. The
borough of Buckingham was at his
disposal, and he was its representative
for thirty years. His rise through
office was rapid. He was first made a
Lord of the Admiralty, then a Lord of
the Treasury, then Treasurer of the
Navy, then Secretary of State, then
First Lord of the Admiralty, until
finally, in April 1763, he rose to be
Premier, or First Lord of the Treasury,
and Chancellor of the Exchequer.
This consummation, however, was
short-lived. Within two years he
was deprived of the premiership, held
office no more, and retired from public
life for ever, leaving, as the principal
memorial of his political career, the
unlucky Stamp Act, so well known as
the pretext for the revolt of America,
the watchword of party in Parliament,
and of faction in the streets, and yet
a measure which no man could fairly
charge with injustice, and whose consequences
no man could charge upon
the minister.</p>

<p>That Parliament had as valid a
right to tax a British colony as it had
to tax a British county, is beyond all
doubt; and, remote as the question
now is with respect to the American
contest, we have other colonies which
may be the wiser for stating its true
grounds.</p>

<p>The British subject emigrating to a
colony, however distant, is still a
British subject; and the child of that
emigrant born in the British colony
is still a British subject. Allegiance
cannot be extinguished by distance.
If he takes arms against England, he
is liable to be punished as a rebel.
The support of the law, the support
of the government, the support of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
fleet and army, all which protect the
empire, and with it the colony, must
require contributions, and the colony,
sharing in the protection, must be
bound to assist that contribution&mdash;it
must pay <em>taxes</em>. The outcry of the
time, that the colonies were taxed
<em>without</em> representation, was utterly
unfounded. The colonies <em>were</em> represented
in the British Parliament;
they were represented by the whole
Parliament legislating for the whole
Empire. The wisdom of adding to
the numbers of a parliament, already
perhaps numerous enough for every
purpose of deliberation, was a question
exclusively for the Government,
and the British colony in America had
no want of advocates; the whole Opposition
were its virtual representatives.</p>

<p>The question of right was thus
decided. The question of policy was
another consideration; and there can
be no doubt that, by admitting
American members into the House,
the United States might have remained
British for a few years longer.
But distance and difficulty, population
and power, would soon have solved
the problem, and the great colony
would have now been a great <em>kingdom</em>.
The war made it a great <em>republic</em>. The
bitterness of hostilities envenomed
the colonies against the only form of
government <em>congenial</em> to the British
mind; and for a limited monarchy,
the most fortunate and rational of all
governments, they adopted a limited
democracy, which nothing but the
extent of their territories could have
prevented, long since, from being an
anarchy. But stubbornness on the
one side, and faction on the other,
prevailed. The Stamp Act was felt to
be so legitimate, in the first instance,
that it scarcely raised a debate in
Parliament. The resistance revived
the spirit of opposition in the legislature.
It was too favourable an opportunity
for metaphorical indignation
and verbal virtue to be thrown away;
and by the help of parliamentary
intrigue, backed by popular outcry,
this natural, obvious, and easy act of
legislature was stigmatised as the
foulest oppression. Time has rectified
the opinion; and while we rejoice in
the prosperity of all nations, we may
calmly respect the principles of social
law.</p>

<p>To George Grenville we owe the
"Act for securing purity of Election,"
which was once regarded as a model
of legislative wisdom, adequate to
preserve the hustings from contamination
and the House from influence
for ever. But the dexterities of
modern corruption have proved too
subtle for the provisions of our ancestors.
How many hundred elections
have been driven through the Grenville
Act, is not for us to say, and it
would perhaps be difficult to calculate.
But the constant lowering of the
franchise has shown the weakness of
all defences against a bribe; and as
the expedient of every new candidate
for popularity is to put the elections
into hands lower still, we may safely
predict the growing inefficiency of
all laws against the temptation to
corrupting of the populace.</p>

<p>The celebrated Burke, in his speech
on American Taxation, a masterpiece
of eloquence, and a masterpiece of
that sophistry in which Party involved
his illustrious spirit <em>for the
time</em>, relieved the House from the
dryness of statistics, by a striking
sketch of Grenville, almost ten years
after his retirement from public life,
and nearly five years after he was in
his tomb.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr Grenville undoubtedly was a
first-rate figure in the country. With a
masculine understanding, and a stout and
resolute heart, he had an application undissipated
and unwearied. He took
public business, not as a duty he was to
fulfil, but as a pleasure he was to enjoy,
and he seemed to have no delight out of
the House, except in such things as in
some way related to the business that
was to be done within it. If he was ambitious,
I will say this for him, his ambition
was of a noble and generous strain.
It was to raise himself, not by the low
politics of a court, but to win his way to
power through the laborious gradations
of public service, and to secure himself a
well-earned rank in Parliament, by a
thorough knowledge of its constitution,
and a perfect practice in all its business."</p></blockquote>

<p>But this panegyric was rather lowered
by its peroration. Burke was fond of
looking at every subject in a variety
of lights, and it became the habit of
even his vigorous mind to fill up the
background of his portraits with picturesque
<em>shade</em>. He then closed his
character of the deceased statesman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
by observing that his having been a
barrister "narrowed the extent and
freedom of his political views."</p>

<p>"He was bred to the law, a science
which does more to quicken and invigorate
the understanding than all
the other kinds of learning put together.
But it is not apt, except in
persons very happily born, to open and
liberalise the mind exactly in the
same proportion." Having flung this
passing sarcasm at the profession, he
let fall a drop of contempt on the
system of public employment.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"From that study, he did not go very
largely into the world, but plunged into
the business of office, and the limited and
fixed forms established there. These
forms are adapted to ordinary occasions,
and therefore persons who are nurtured
in office do admirably well so long as
things go on in their common order; but
when the highroads are broken up, and
the waters are out, when a new and
troubled scene is opened, and the file
affords no precedent, then it is that a
greater knowledge of mankind, and a far
more extensive comprehension of things,
is requisite than ever office gave, or than
office ever can give. Mr Grenville thought
better of the wisdom and power of human
legislation than, in truth, it deserves."</p></blockquote>

<p>The fact evidently is, that the fiery
and soaring spirit of Burke despised
the heavy uniformity and dull routine
of the whole tribe of which Grenville
was the representative; that he disdained
the substitution of heavy regularity
for brilliant enterprise, of
precedent for principle, and of taking
shelter under obsolete forms, instead
of adopting those lofty innovations
which alone can guide a government
through new perils, deserve the name
of statesmanship, and elevate politics
into the dignity of a science.</p>

<p>But this attempt to qualify his
panegyric, by laying the weight of
Grenville's failure on his profession,
was keenly retorted by Wedderburn,
(then Solicitor-General, and afterwards
Chancellor and Earl of Rosslyn,)
declaring that he had no intention
of taking a part in the debate,
but that he had been called up by
Burke's character of Grenville. He
observed, "that the gentleman had
neither done him that justice with
which posterity might treat his memory,
nor had he spoken of him as
the general voice of a grateful people
would even at that moment express
itself of his person, his conduct, and
his acts." After alluding to the remark,
that his mind was narrowed by
the bar, and that he had plunged into
office before he mingled in the world,
Wedderburn (who <em>might</em> have observed
that he came into Parliament
and politics at twenty-nine, consequently
had practised but little in his
profession, and that at thirty-three he
held the office of a Lord of the Admiralty)
said cleverly&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Going into the world is a term too large
for my narrow comprehension. If it means
that he neither played, nor dressed, nor
was a member of any of the fashionable
clubs, I believe it may be true. But his
birth and his talents introduced him to an
early intimacy with the first men of the
age. He passed, by regular gradations,
from one office to another. Whatever
related to the Marine of this country, he
had learned during his attendance at the
Admiralty. The Finance he had studied
under a very able master at the Treasury.
The Foreign Department was for a time
intrusted to him. The proper business
of the House was for several years his
particular study. In almost every various
office of the state he had acquired a
practical knowledge, improved by theory;
and, from the general course of his observation
and researches, he had adopted
principles and habits which the firm temper
of his mind would not stoop to abandon
or unlearn, in complaisance to the
opinions of any man. Such were the
<em>disqualifications</em> under which Mr Grenville
was called forth to the first situation
of administration, at a time when ancient
<em>prejudices</em> were still respected, and before
it was understood that parts were
spoiled by application, that ignorance
was preferable to knowledge, and that
any <em>lively man of imagination</em>, without
practice in office, and without experience,
might start up at once, a self-taught minister,
and undertake the management of
a great country in difficult times."</p></blockquote>

<p>We have given these extracts, as
displaying both sides of the character,
and by comparison enabling the student
of history to form an estimate of
a man who for twenty-one years had
been exercised in the various administrations
of the empire, and who
finally rose to the highest official rank
in the country.</p>

<p>But it is still more to the advantage
of his character, and it may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
constituted the chief secret of his success,
that he was a man of integrity;
that the corruptions universally
charged upon Walpole were never
fixed on him; that, in an age when
the highest rank in the realm often
startled the nation, by following foreign
fashions of morality, he was a
good father, a faithful husband, and
a firm friend.</p>

<p>One of the observations which these
volumes force upon us, is the agreeable
evidence of the improvement in
the public health. Every man in
high station seems to have been the
victim of a perpetual tendency to disease.
Ministers seem universally to
have been tortured by gout, or some
painful disorder, which drove them to
the country, the Continent, or the
Bath waters. The women of rank
had some unaccountable and indescribable
malady of their own, which
they called the Vapours; every judge
had some excruciating disorder, which
he could alleviate only by opium;
every man of letters had some ailment
of the same kind. The common people,
living in the unventilated and obscure
haunts of cities, had, of course, all
the diseases which we are now so
slowly striving to prevent; and the
ploughman appeared to enjoy the only
health in the land. How far the improvement
in this all-important matter
may be owing to improved medical
science, to the drainage of the soil, to
more extended agriculture, or to some
fortunate change in the atmosphere,
or even to the adoption of more temperate
habits, and the substitution of
lighter food, we cannot precisely say;
but there can be scarcely a doubt of the
change in the general state of health, in
the duration of life, in the proportion
of those who grow up to maturity to
those who die in infancy, and even in
the continued vigour of the frame and
faculties to a more advanced age.</p>

<p>The first letter in the correspondence
is from Lord Cornbury, recommending
Mr Grenville to travel for his recovery
from a sickness which apparently
enfeebled all his earlier years.
His lordship suggests the south of
France as a supplement to Bath,
where he had gone to drink the waters,
then a <em>panacea</em> for the distempers
of high life, and where his residence
is mentioned in a lively epistle
from Lyttleton to Pope. "George
Grenville is in a fair way of recovery;
the waters agree with him. Cheyne
(the physician) says he is a giant, a
son of Anak, made like Gilbert, the
Lord Bishop of Sarum, and may,
therefore, if he pleases, <em>live for ever</em>;
his present sickness being nothing but
a fillip given for his good, to make him
temperate, and put him under the care
of Dr Cheyne."</p>

<p>Lord Cornbury was an amiable
young man, given to hospitality and
letter-writing, and panegyrised by
Pope in such tributes as his pretended
scorn for nobility did not prevent
him from paying to his entertainers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Would you be blest, despise low joys, low gains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disdain whatever Cornbury disdains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be virtuous, and be happy, for your pains."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such are the honours and the advice
of poetry; but it may be suggested
that a British peer has little
temptation to <em>low</em> joys or low gains,
and that it is not difficult to bear the
trials of life in possession of every
advantage which life can give. The
pungent pen of Lady Wortley Montague
gives an easier account of this
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">dilettante</i> lord on his death. "He had
certainly a very good heart: I have
often thought it a great pity it was
not under the direction of a better
head. His desire of fixing his name
to a certain quantity of <em>wall</em>, is one
instance, among thousands, of the
passion men have for <em>perpetuating
their memory</em>"&mdash;(possibly an allusion,
sufficiently contemptuous, to his having
built at Cornbury Park in Oxfordshire.)</p>

<p>We next have a letter from the
first Lord Lyttleton, on the subject of
a tour which the minister was still
making, recommending that he should
not risk his final recovery by coming
to the House of Commons,&mdash;"Not
that, if you were present, either you
or I could do any good."</p>

<p>Lord Hervey, in his <cite>Memoirs of the
Reign of George II.</cite>, gives a sketch
of Lyttleton, such as a modern fop
might give of a successful rival, closing
with&mdash;"He had a great flow of
words, that were always uttered in a
lulling monotony; and the little meaning
they had to boast of was generally
borrowed from the commonplace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
maxims and sentiments of moralists,
philosophers, patriots, and poets,
crudely imbibed, half-digested, ill put
together, and confusedly refunded."</p>

<p>Such was the caricature of <em>the</em>
Lyttleton with whose poems all the
ladies of England were enamoured,
and who won all the plaudits of the
clergy by his "Tract on the Conversion
of St Paul;" certainly a very
clever performance, and an extraordinary
one, as coming from a man living
in the fashionable circles of the
last century.</p>

<p>Then follows a letter from the celebrated
Lord Mansfield on the same
subject:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am very impatient for your recovery,
and I rejoice in the favourable accounts
I hear. I rambled about, as usual,
during the leisure hours I had; and,
among other places I was at, I spent
three days most agreeably at Hagley with
our friends Lyttleton and Pitt; where,
you may believe, you <em>was</em>&mdash;[<i>sic</i>, in orig.]&mdash;not
forgot.... Pope is at Bath,
perched upon his hill, making epigrams,
and <em>stifling</em> them in their birth; and Lord
H., [Hervey]&mdash;would you believe it!&mdash;is
writing libels on the king and his ministers."</p></blockquote>

<p>Lord Hervey was the son of the
first Earl of Bristol&mdash;was the most
inveterate courtier of his time, and in
remarkable confidence with the whole
of the royal family. Unfortunately,
he knew <em>too much</em>, and has bequeathed
his knowledge to posterity in a Memoir,
fatal to the moral character of
his age, yet lively, epigrammatic, and
anecdotical. The whole family, even
to the close of the century, were eccentric.
The keen and witty Lady
Wortley Montague defined them as a
third class of the human race&mdash;"men,
women, and <em>Herveys</em>."</p>

<p>Those were curious times. The
letter ends with the news that Lord
Bradford's <em>mistress</em>, to whom he had
left his estate, had bequeathed it to
Pulteney, Earl of Bath. Thus that
most parsimonious of all peers got
£12,000 a-year!</p>

<p>A letter from Richard Grenville
(Lord Temple) to his brother, when
abroad, thus gives him the political
news of the day:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Lord Cobham and Lord Gower have
refused going into the cabinet, and we
have had very warm work in the House
of Commons, the first day, upon the Address.
Pitt (Earl of Chatham) spoke like
ten thousand angels! and your humble
servant was so inflamed at their indecency,
that he could not contain, but
talked a good while with his usual modesty....
We divided 150 against
259; we reckon ourselves, however, 200.
And it is inconceivable how <em>colloquing</em>
and flattering all the ministers are to all
of us, notwithstanding our impertinence....
Who but young Bathurst to answer
me, in the most ridiculous, indecent,
stupid speech that ever was made. It
was melancholy, but entertaining enough,
to see them skulk in, with their tails betwixt
their legs, like so many spaniels....
We shall have a glorious day about
the sixteen thousand. We shall then see,
also, who are Hanoverians and who Englishmen."</p></blockquote>

<p>The day of the sixteen thousand was
the debate on fixing the subsidy for
the payment of that number of Hanoverian
troops. On this point Opposition
made a great and popular stand,
contending, truly enough, that nothing
could be more derogatory to the
honour of a great country than the
employment of mercenaries; but
George II. had all the prejudices of a
German Elector on the subject, and
the motion was urged and carried.</p>

<p>The first two Georges seemed actually
to think that the English throne
depended on the Hanoverian, and that
the security of England itself was imperfect
without a few German brigades.
The third George, however,
was of a different opinion; he boasted
of his "being born a Briton;" and in
that manly and rational feeling, he
found England able to defend herself.</p>

<p>The Bathurst mentioned in the letter
was the son of the lively and
pleasant old Lord Bathurst, the associate
of Pope and the wits of his day,
alluded to in Burke's fine Episode of
American Progress. This son became
Lord Chancellor. There is an
allusion to Bubb Dodington in the
letter referring to his marriage. He
led a loose life; and in this instance
Horace Walpole gave him but little
credit for reformation:&mdash;"Mr Dodington
has at last owned his match
with his old mistress. I suppose he
wants a <em>new</em> one."</p>

<p>Dodington (Lord Melcombe) deserves
some recollection for the mere
sake of his political <em>flexibility</em>. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
entered Parliament young, and was
shortly after sent Envoy to Spain.
Inheriting a considerable fortune from
his father, whose name was Bubb, he
acquired a large estate by the death
of his maternal uncle, Dodington,
whose name he took in consequence.
Still the pursuit of place was the business
of his life, and he became proverbial
for the eagerness of his avarice,
and the slipperiness of his principles.
Some talent, some plausibility,
great perseverance, and unblushing
impudence, gained him a succession
of employments under all the
successive parties. Beginning his
political life under Walpole, by whom
he was appointed a Lord of the Treasury,
he secured for himself the lucrative
sinecure of the Clerkship of the
Pells in Ireland. When Walpole
began to totter, Dodington <em>ratted</em>; and
when the minister finally fell, he was
made a sharer in the spoil, obtaining
the Treasurership of the Navy. When
Frederick, Prince of Wales, started
in opposition, Dodington hastened to
worship the rising sun, and became
head of the "Prince's party." When
Frederick died, Dodington returned
to his old quarters, and figured again
as Treasurer of the Navy, under the
Newcastle administration.</p>

<p>On the death of George II., Lord
Bute was the new dispenser of places,
and Dodington joined him accordingly.
His reward was the peerage in
the same year. This was the summit
of his busy, arrogant, aspiring, and
<em>humiliating</em> career. Whether he contemplated
further experiments on fortune
is not now to be known, for he
enjoyed his <em>honours</em> but a twelvemonth,
dying in 1762. All this labour
of servility was for himself alone, for
he had no offspring. His <cite>Diary</cite> is
familiar to the readers of political
biography, and it is uniformly quoted
as the most singular instance, in public
life, of fearless exposure to contempt,
of sinister caution, and conscious
tergiversation.</p>

<p>A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mot</i> of Chesterfield was long
remembered. Dodington, on going
abroad on some mission, observed to
Chesterfield the vexation of having
such a name as Bubb appended to his
better-sounding appellation. "Poh!"
said Chesterfield, "enlarge it&mdash;call
yourself Silly-bubb."</p>

<p>In this correspondence, it is surprising
that we meet so few references
to the invasion of the Pretender in
1745, unless we are to account for it
by the letters having been destroyed.
The event itself was the most memorable
since the Civil War; and if the
nation had been less Protestant, it
might have changed the dynasty.
But the bigotry of James II. had
raised a spirit of determined resistance
to his line, which nothing but
actual overthrow in the field could
extinguish. The enterprise was gallantly
conceived, and as gallantly
executed by the Highlanders; but
there was a want of force. The Clans
fought boldly, but their blood was
shed in vain; and the invasion actually
gave additional strength to the
Protestant throne.</p>

<p>One of George Grenville's letters
adverts to the progress of events
briefly in these words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The last accounts from the North
say that the Highlanders have begun
plundering part of the country between
Edinburgh and Berwick. This manner
of proceeding may be an unfortunate one
with respect to those on whom it falls;
but cannot be more so to them than to
the party which suffers it, whose hopes,
I think, it must entirely destroy, if carried
to any length. It is now said that
the Castle of Edinburgh is in great want
of provisions; that the governor of the
Castle ordered the inhabitants of the city
to supply him, and threatened, in case of
refusal, to burn the town, and beat it
down about their ears. They obeyed for
two or three days; but then the Highlanders
threatened them with military
execution if they continued it any longer;
upon which they desisted immediately:
and the magistrates have applied to the
King, stating their miserable situation,
and beseeching him to give orders to the
governor not to execute his threats. The
answer to the application I do not know;
but I imagine it is a favourable one."</p></blockquote>

<p>An amusing feature of these volumes
is the style in which public
men, in the last age, spoke of each
other. It was contemptuous in the
extreme&mdash;every character was a caricature.
Pitt, in a letter to George
Grenville, had alluded to Sir William
Yonge, a veteran placeman, as telling
him of Grenville's "being very well;
and I most sincerely hope he tells me
truth. I could more easily pardon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
any of the <em>fictions</em> in which he sometimes
deals, than one on this occasion."</p>

<p>Lord Hervey, in his <cite>Memoirs</cite>, thus
sketches Yonge:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Without having done anything that
I know of remarkably profligate, anything
out of the common track of a ductile
courtier and a parliamentary tool,
his name was proverbially used to express
everything pitiful, corrupt, and contemptible.
It is true, he was a great <em>liar</em>,
but rather a mean than a vicious one.
He had been always constant to the same
party, he was good-natured and good-humoured,
never offensive in company,
nobody's friend, nobody's enemy....
He had a great command of what is called
parliamentary language, and a talent of
talking eloquently without a meaning,
and expatiating agreeably upon nothing,
beyond any man, I believe, that ever had
the gift of speech."</p></blockquote>

<p>After all, this description leaves
Yonge, as regards talents, a very considerable
man. His lying, however,
blackens the whole character. Yet
it throve with him; for he was, in
succession, Commissioner of the Admiralty,
and of the Treasury, Secretary-at-War,
finishing all by the opulent
sinecure of joint-Treasurer of
Ireland.</p>

<p>All the Memoirs of the time remind
us of the adage of Solomon, "There
is nothing new under the sun." Who
will not recognise, in the character of
Admiral Vernon, (which has had the
honour to be delineated by Lord
John Russell,) something of a celebrated
living Admiral?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Vernon was a man of undoubted
talent, but ill qualified, by his character,
to govern those under him, or to obey
those above him. Vernon was raised to
the rank of Admiral of the White, in
April 1745. He was immediately appointed
to the command of the fleet, for
the defence of the Channel and north
coast, and in this situation his vigilance
has been greatly commended. The Board
of Admiralty, however, having found fault
with some of his dispositions of the force,
he complained bitterly, and, after an
angry correspondence, desired leave to
strike his flag. The Admiralty, finding
it useless to give orders, which were
always cavilled at, complied with his
request. Hereupon, the Admiral, who
seems to have thought that the public
would support him against the Government,
published two pamphlets, in which
he revealed the orders he had received,
and published, without leave, his official
correspondence. The Admiralty visited
this offence in the most severe manner.
Admiral Vernon was called on to attend
the Board. When he appeared, the Duke
of Bedford asked him, if he was the publisher
of the two pamphlets. He declined
to answer the question. The Duke of
Bedford then informed him that the
Board, after such a refusal, could not but
consider him as the publisher. He stated
his surprise that he should have been
asked such a question, and withdrew.
The next day, the Duke of Bedford saw
the King, and signified to the Board the
King's pleasure that Vice-Admiral Vernon
should be struck out of the list of
flag-officers."</p></blockquote>

<p>A letter from Pitt speaks of his
election, and the unlucky battle of
Lauffeldt, in the same breath.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My dear Grenville,&mdash;I am this moment
arrived from Sussex, victorious as
yourself, (Grenville had just been elected
for Bridport,) after being opposed by Mr
Gage and the Earl of Middlesex. It is
certain my own success does not give me
more pleasure than yours does....
Would to God our victories were not
confined to our own little world. A full
detail of the late action I have not yet
seen. The clearest and best makes it
evident that the British and Electoral
troops did all that can be expected from
men overpowered by numbers, the whole
weight being upon them. The Duke (of
Cumberland) has done himself great
honour, by the efforts he made in person
during the action," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>William Duke of Cumberland was
always unfortunate on the Continent,
and, we believe, never succeeded
but at Culloden. In the
battle of Lauffeldt, Walpole says,
"he was very near taken, having,
through his short sight, mistaken a
body of French for his own people.
He behaved as bravely as usual; but
(he adds sarcastically) his prowess
is so well established, that it grows
time for him to exert other qualities
of a general."</p>

<p>In this action, considerable loss
seems to have taken place among the
officers of rank. Walpole says of Conway&mdash;"Harry
Conway, whom nature
always designed for a hero of romance,
and who is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">deplace</i> life,
did wonders, but was overpowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
and flung down, when one French
hussar held him by the hair, while
another was going to stab him. At
the instant, an English sergeant, with
a soldier, came up and killed the
latter, but was instantly killed himself.
The soldier attacked the other,
and Mr Conway escaped, but was
afterwards taken prisoner, and is
since released on parole."</p>

<p>The description of the Lord Middlesex,
mentioned in the letter, has
all the keenness of Walpole's style.
(He was the eldest son of the Duke
of Dorset, and Master of the Horse
to the Prince of Wales.) "His figure
was handsome, had all the reserve of
his family, and all the dignity of his
ancestors. His passion was the
direction of operas, in which he had
not only wasted immense sums, but
had stood lawsuits in Westminster
Hall with some of those poor devils
for their salaries. The Duke of Dorset
had often paid his debts, but
never could work upon his affections;
and he had at last carried his disobedience
so far, in complaisance to, and
in imitation of the Prince, as to oppose
his father in his own boroughs."</p>

<p>The death of Pelham, in 1754,
awoke the bustle of parties in a singular
degree. The activity of Fox
(Lord Holland) was remarked by
every one. Pelham had died about
six in the morning; Fox was at
Lord Hartington's door <em>before eight</em>,
called on Pitt at an "early hour;"
and a letter from Lord Hardwicke
says&mdash;"A certain person (Fox) within
a few hours after Mr Pelham's
death, had made strong advances to
the Duke of Newcastle and myself."
Pitt's letter, addressed to Lyttleton
and the Grenvilles, containing the
proposal for a new cabinet, thus
speaks of Fox:&mdash;"As to the nomination
of a Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Mr Fox, in point of party,
seniority in the corps, and, I think,
of ability for Treasury and House of
Commons business, stands, upon the
whole, first of any. Dr Lee, if his
health permits, would be very desirable.
You, my dear Grenville, would
be my nomination. A fourth idea,
which, if practicable, might have
great strength and efficiency for Government
in it&mdash;I mean to <em>secularise</em>,
if I may use the expression, the Solicitor-General
(Murray,) and make
him Chancellor of the Exchequer."</p>

<p>This fabric of the ministerial brain
vanished, and Pitt remained in the
subordinate position of Paymaster of
the Forces. The ostensible cause was,
the King's disinclination to have any
intercourse with Pitt. That disinclination,
however, ceased to be a
pretext when Pitt became necessary
to the Crown.</p>

<p>The fluctuations of memorable
minds are the most interesting part
of their history. Pitt's political disappointments
always brought on a fit
of his philosophy. When fortune
smiled again, he forgot the philosophy,
and grasped at the political prize.
After the failure of his plan for the
cabinet, he flew to Bath, and there,
between disgust and distemper, he
became romantic.</p>

<p>He thus writes to Earl Temple:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am still the same indolent, inactive
thing your lordship saw me; insomuch
that I can hear unmoved of Parliament's
assembling, and Speakers choosing, and
all other great earthly things. I live the
vernal day on verdant hills or sequestered
valleys, where, to be poetical, for me
health gushes from a thousand springs;
and I enjoy the return of her, and the
absence of that thing called Ambition,
with no small philosophic delight. In a
word, I envy not the favourites of Heaven,
the few, the very few, '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quos æquus
amavit Jupiter</i>;' the dust of Kensington
causey, or the verdure of Lincoln's-Inn-Fields."
(The King resided at Kensington,
and the Duke of Newcastle in
Lincoln's-Inn-Fields.) "I shall despatch
my necessary business as fast as I can,
and pursue you to Stowe, where the
charms, so seldom found, of true taste,
and the more rare joys and comforts of
true friendship, have fixed their happy
residence. There it is that I most impatiently
long to enjoy you and your
works."</p></blockquote>

<p>Wilkes now comes on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tapis</i>.
A letter from Earl Temple congratulates
him on having returned from
the "expensive delights of Berwick."
"I hope this will find you in good
health, spirits as usual, and with an
excellent cause. It is very gracious
and kind in the pious Æneas, after
his conversion after the love-feast, to
keep up that kind of friendship with
one who has so slender a claim to be
admitted to the table of the saints."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>The letter is written in a strain
fitter for Wilkes than for a man in
a public rank, and with a public character.
The "expensive delights of
Berwick" was an allusion to Wilkes's
contest for the borough, which cost
him between three and four thousand
pounds, and in which he was defeated
after all by the Delaval interest.
Fox's description of the debate on
the petition is pungent. "Mr Wilkes,
a friend, it seems, of Pitt, (so little
was he publicly known at this period,)
petitioned against the younger Delaval,
chose (chosen) at Berwick, on
the ground of bribery only. Delaval
made a speech, on his being thus
attacked, full of wit, humour, and
buffoonery, which kept the House in
a continued roar of laughter."</p>

<p>From this period, for forty years,
Wilkes flourished before the public.
The man will do a striking service to
the history of the constitution, of
popular passion, and of political character,
who shall write a "History of
Wilkes." There have been memoirs
of his life, publications of his letters,
and registers of his political victories;
but these are still but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires pour
Servir</i>. The history of the <em>partisan</em>
is yet to be written; and it will still
be the more curious, since it will be
the history of a political age, which
could have existed in no other country.
Wilkes was embodied Demagogism.
Athens might have her
Cleon, Naples her Massaniello, and
modern Rome her Rienzi; but England
alone could produce a Wilkes,
tolerate him, triumph in him, struggle
for him, and finally pay to his indolent,
helpless, and exhausted old age,
almost the same popular veneration
which the multitude had paid when
his intrigues convulsed the whole
fabric of the state. A temperament
daring, crafty, and unscrupulous, a
fluent pen, and a sarcastic wit, were
the instruments of an ambition as
remorseless, worldly, and grasping,
as dwelt in the bosom of a Cæsar
Borgia or a Catiline.</p>

<p>An outline of this singular man's
bustling career will best show the
pertinacity, the trials, and the troubles
which belonged to the candidate
for the Tribuneship of Great Britain.</p>

<p>John Wilkes, born in 1727, the son
of a rich distiller, began his public
life in the canvass for Berwick&mdash;alluded
to by Lord Temple's letter.
Having lost that election, he obtained
a seat for Aylesbury, which involved
him in heavy expenses. Parliament
now became his resource and his profession;
and he connected himself
with Lord Temple, who gave him the
colonelcy of the Buckingham militia.</p>

<p>In 1762, on the retirement of Lord
Temple and Pitt from the ministry,
he became an Opposition pamphleteer.
Lord Bute, though a man of ability,
was unpopular, as the royal favourite,
and Wilkes attacked him in the <cite>North
Briton</cite>. In 1763, Lord Bute resigned,
and Wilkes, in the memorable No.
45 of the <cite>North Briton</cite>, libelled the
King's speech. The sarcasm stung
so deep that a prosecution was ordered
against him. The prosecution
finally became a triumph. The Home
Secretary having issued a "General
Warrant" for the apprehension of the
author, printers, and publishers of
the libel, Wilkes, on his arrest, denied
its legality, and, as a member of
Parliament, was committed to the
Tower. The attention of the country
was now fixed on the question. He
was brought up before Chief Baron
Pratt, who decided on the illegality
of general warrants, and he was discharged
amid the popular acclamations.
Wilkes, in his turn, brought
actions against the Home Secretary,
the under secretaries, the messengers,
&amp;c., and gained them all, with
damages&mdash;the Crown paying the
damages. He was now the declared
champion of the populace.</p>

<p>He republished the libel&mdash;fought a
duel on the subject&mdash;was severely
wounded&mdash;and fled to France. A
second prosecution was commenced,
and, on his non-appearance, he was
expelled from the House of Commons.
A third prosecution was commenced
against him for language in a publication
which was pronounced flagitious;
and not returning to meet it,
he was <em>outlawed</em>.</p>

<p>On the change of ministry he returned
to England, and was imprisoned;
and yet, during his imprisonment,
was elected for Middlesex. He
was tried, and condemned to remain
in jail twenty-two months, or be
fined £1000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1769, in consequence of a
pamphlet censuring the ministry for
the employment of troops to suppress
the riots at his election, he was again
expelled, and again elected.</p>

<p>He was now declared incapable of
sitting in Parliament, and Colonel
Luttrel was returned as the sitting
member, though with but a fourth of
the votes. This act roused the popular
indignation once more.</p>

<p>Wilkes, driven from Parliament,
now turned to the city, and was elected
alderman; and on some printers being
brought before him, apprehended by
a Royal proclamation, he discharged
them all, on the ground of maintaining
the privileges of the city. The
Lord Mayor, Oliver, and Crosby, an
alderman, followed Wilkes's example,
and being members of the House,
were sent to the Tower. Wilkes, on
being ordered to attend at the bar,
claimed his seat. Ministers now
dreading further involvement, adjourned
the House over the day
appointed for his attendance, and, in
1774, he took his seat in triumph as
member for Middlesex!</p>

<p>But his fortune was now decayed;
old age was coming on, and he was
glad to be chosen Chamberlain for
London, (with a salary of nearly £4000
a-year.) On the fall of the North
Cabinet, 1782, he moved that the
resolution against him on the Journals
should be expunged. The motion
was carried; his victory was complete,
and the remainder of his life
was opulent and calm. That remainder,
however, was brief, for he died
in 1797, at the age of seventy.</p>

<p>Wilkes was a man of education, a
man of wit, and a man of intrepidity.
But his education had begun under an
English sectary, and was finished in
a foreign college&mdash;the first accounting
for his republicanism, the next for
his dissoluteness. But, though the
man himself was worthless, his struggles
were not unprofitable to the
country. They fixed the popular
attention on the principles of national
liberty; they brought all the great
constitutional questions into perpetual
study. They rendered the public
mind so sensitive to the possible
encroachments of the Crown, or even
of the Commons, that the future
tyranny of any branch of the Legislature
would be next to impossible.
Let the merit of Wilkes be, that he
drew a <em>fence</em> round the Constitution.</p>

<p>But Wilkes had a support unknown
to the public of his time, yet amply
divulged in these volumes. He
appears to have kept up a constant
correspondence with Earl Temple,
the head of the Grenville interest;
to have been anxious for his opinion
on his publications, and to have depended
on him, even for pecuniary
resources, which probably were applied
to those publications. The connection
of Wilkes in public sentiment with
the Grenvilles, was, of course, well
known; but we doubt if the evidence
of an intimate agency was
understood before. In these letters,
Wilkes twice draws on Lord Temple
for £500; and as his lordship was
opulent, and his client quite the
reverse, it is likely that those calls
were not the only instances of craving.
But this connection largely
accounts for the otherwise marvellous
daring of Wilkes. He had the
Grenvilles, Pitt, and their whole connection,
then a most powerful party,
to fall back upon. The Cabinet
which sent him to prison one day,
might be succeeded by the Cabinet
which would open his gates the next;
his patrons might be the possessors
of all power, and in the mean time,
however he might be persecuted, he
was sure not to be crushed.</p>

<p>We have a letter from Lord Temple
on this subject, which shows, by
its wish to mislead suspicion, the
nature of this intimacy. The letter
is from a corrected and much obliterated
draught, in Lord Temple's handwriting;
and as the editor says, "The
very guarded manner in which the
letter is expressed, renders it probable
that Lord Temple expected that
it would be read in the Post Office
before it reached its destination; for
it cannot be supposed that he was
ignorant of the connection between
the North Briton and Wilkes. Almon
(the printer) says, "Lord Temple was
not ignorant of his friend's design,
and certainly approved of it."</p>

<p>The letter thus begins&mdash;"As to
public events, I am sorry to see that
the paper hostilities are renewed with
so high a degree of acrimony as now
appears on all sides; and although I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
make it a rule not to agitate any matter
of a political nature by the Post&mdash;this
Argus, with, at least, a hundred
eyes&mdash;yet, while my thoughts agree
with Government, I may venture to
hazard them, subject even to that
<em>inspection</em>. I am <em>quite at loss</em> to guess
through what channel the <i>North Briton</i>
flows." The remainder is a critique
on the paper, concluding, "as
the N. B. will, I suppose, endeavour
by every means to lie concealed,
it will be impossible to ferret
him out, and give him good advice,
otherwise I am sure I could convince
him."</p>

<p>The caution of this note shows at
once the confidential nature of the
connection, and the consciousness of
the responsibility. But the subsequent
letters of Lord Temple to
Wilkes prove the continued and
increased interest taken by his lordship
in Wilkes's political productions.
A paper, called the <cite>Monitor</cite>, whether
edited by Wilkes or not, but evidently
conceived by Lord Temple to be
under his direction, having expressed
strong opinions relative to the royal
personages, his lordship writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As all the sins of the <cite>Monitor</cite> against
the ruling powers are principally charged
upon our friend B., [Bradmore, his attorney,]
and then, by way of rebound, upon
<em>two other persons</em>, to whom the <cite>Monitor</cite>
has been so kindly partial, it is of the
more moment to avoid that sort of personality
which regards any of the R. F.,
[royal family.] I am glad, therefore,
<em>my hint</em> came, at least, time enough to
prevent the publication of what would
have filled up the whole measure of
offence.... As to other matters,
sportsmen, I suppose, are at liberty to
pursue lawful game. I am only solicitous
to have them not trespassers within the
bounds of royal manors.... I hope
I may be allowed to defray the loss and
the expense of <em>laying aside the paper you
sent me</em>."</p></blockquote>

<p>This evidently implies that the
paper was submitted to his lordship
before publication.</p>

<p>The intercourse of a man like
Wilkes, a notorious profligate, and
impeached in public for his excess of
profligacy, could not have been suffered
by a man alive to character, but
for some motive beyond the public
eye; it was, of course, political, the
common pursuit of an object, which is
presumed to salve all sins.</p>

<p>A strong instance of their intimacy
occurs in what Wilkes might have
considered as his last act in this
world. Lord Talbot, having been
attacked in the <cite>North Briton</cite>, demanded
an apology from Wilkes, who
denied his lordship's right to question
him. A challenge ensued, which
produced a meeting, which produced
an exchange of shots, without injury
on either side. But Wilkes had given
to his second, Colonel Berkeley, a note
to be delivered, in case of his fall, to
Earl Temple. This note Berkeley
desired to return to Wilkes on the
close of the affair; but it was forwarded
to Temple, "as a proof of the
regard and affection he bore your
lordship, at a minute which might
have been his last."</p>

<p>Wilkes's letter is dated</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Bagshot</span>, <i>Nov. 5&mdash;Seven at night.</i>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;I am here, just going to
decide a point of honour with Lord Talbot.
I have only to thank your lordship
for all your favours to me; and to entreat
you to desire Lady Temple to superintend
the education of a daughter, whom I love
beyond all the world. I am, my Lord,
your obliged and affectionate humble
servant,</p>

<p>The second volume contains the
Correspondence of Ministers, actual
and expectant, down to 1764. Among
those letters is one which exhibits a
curious coincidence with the late
transactions of the Foreign Office,
though the relative positions of the
persons were changed.</p>

<p>"What think you of the Duke of B.,
[Bedford, then ambassador in Paris,]

<p>The volume abounds in references
to high names. Among the rest we
have a "Note" from the great Samuel
Johnson, which, though only a receipt
for his pension, has the value of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
a national remembrancer:&mdash;"To Mr
Grenville. Sir,&mdash;Be pleased to pay
to the bearer seventy-five pounds,
being the quarterly payment of a pension
granted by his Majesty, and due
on the 29th of June last to, Sir, your
humble servant, <span class="smcap">Sam. Johnson</span>."
The merit of this pension, so worthily
bestowed, was due to Wedderburn,
afterwards Earl of Rosslyn, and Chancellor.</p>

<p>A letter from the Countess Temple
contains some lively Court gossip.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mrs Ryde was here yesterday. She
is acquainted with a brother of one of the
yeomen of the guard. He tells her, that
the King cannot live without my Lord
<em>Bute</em>. If he goes out anywhere, he stops,
when he comes back, to ask if my Lord
Bute is come yet. And that his lords,
or people that are about him, look as
mad as can be at it."</p>

<p>"The mob have a good story of the
Duke of Devonshire, (Lord Chamberlain.)
That he went first, to light the King;
and the King followed him, leaning on
Lord Bute's shoulder; upon which the
Duke of Devonshire turned about, and
desired to know 'whom he was waiting
upon?'"</p></blockquote>

<p>The name of the Chevalier D'Eon
occurs in the Correspondence as demanding
some wine detained in the
Customs. The Chevalier was a personage
who excited great public curiosity,
even almost within our own
time. He had been a captain of
French dragoons, and was brought to
England as the secretary to the Duc
de Nivernois, who conducted the negotiations
for the peace of 1763. On
the Duke's departure, he left D'Eon
minister-plenipotentiary. The Count
de Guerchy, the new ambassador,
desired him to resume the post of
secretary; this hurt his pride, and he
quarrelled with the ambassador and
with the English Court, but was pensioned
by France. A report at length
was spread that D'Eon was actually
a female; this the Chevalier fiercely
denied, and we believe threatened to
shoot the authors of the report. However,
in a short time after, he adopted
the dress of a female, and retained it
till he died. As all matters in England
<em>then</em> turned to gambling, wagers
were laid on the subject; until, at
length, it was proved that the assumption
of the female dress was
either an eccentricity or a wilful imposture.
His pension having been
cut off by the Revolution, this singular
person was reduced to great
difficulties; so much so, that, to raise
money, he appeared as a fencer on
the stage, but still appeared in
woman's costume.</p>

<p>We must now close our observations
on this collection, which is indispensable
to the historian of the
time. Not referring to any of those
great transactions which make the
characteristics, or the catastrophes,
of nations, these letters exhibit the
<em>interior</em> of public life with remarkable
minuteness, and must have a peculiar
interest for public men. But,
with the honours of the statesman,
they lay before us so vivid an example
of the troubles, the vexations, and
the disappointments of political life,
and the struggles of men possessing
the highest abilities and the highest
character, that we doubt whether a
more stringent moral against political
ambition ever came before the eyes
of England.</p>

<p>Some years ago we had taken our
passage for Alexandria on board a
packet from Valletta. The Ægyptus,
spick and span new from the
Toulon dockyard, with the tricolor
flaunting over her stern all resplendent
with gilded sphynxes, lay, steam
up and ready for departure, near the
centre of the Great Harbour, amid
that glorious cluster of cities which
the knights of St John reared round
the banner of the Cross, when Christendom
was forced to shorten her
cords and draw in her outposts before
the swelling power of the unbelievers.
Berth selected, baggage stowed away,
and hour of dinner ascertained, we
were at leisure to enjoy the familiar
but never palling glories of the sky
and scenery, and to amuse ourselves
in watching the travellers of various
nations who, party by party, mounted
the deck, speculating the while on
whatever promised in the first aspect
of those who were to be our messmates
on the five days' voyage.
They were not numerous or very interesting&mdash;a
party of French artists,
bloused and bearded, who returned
from their brief circuit of Valletta as
full of the stalwart figures and novel
costume of its garrison (the Forty-Second)
as of the picturesque grandeur
of its palaces, or the Titanic
sublimity of its bulwarks&mdash;a grey-haired
English veteran proceeding to
his divisional command in India, with
wife and daughters, and a most ante-Napierian
baggage-train, received by
M. le Commandant with scowling
courtesy, as if the stately dame were
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perfide Albion</i> in proper person&mdash;then
one or two half-Frenchified Moslems,
returning from their studies in Paris
with a complement of Western vice
and science&mdash;and lastly, in coarse
brown robe, sandalled feet, and shaven
crown, with shining breviary beneath
the arm, three Capuchin monks,
going forth to make disciples for Holy
Church in the far East. Each of the
latter had his trunk&mdash;one of those
lanky, hog-backed articles in which
the continental European rejoices&mdash;and
on the trunk his name and destination
painted. Two, if we remember,
were bound for Agra&mdash;the destination
of the third we never can
forget. On his coffer the painter had
inscribed, as coolly, we daresay, as a
railway porter would ticket your
portmanteau for York or Glasgow,</p>

<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">Fr. Anastasio</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Tibet</span>."
</p>

<p>"It is a far cry to Loch Ow;" and
whether brother Anastasius and his
long pack ever reached their destination
as per ticket we know not. But
Tibet and its capital have since been
visited by two brethren of his Church,
though not of his order; and we have
to thank Mr Prinsep for calling attention
to their narrative in the very
able abstract which he has published.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>To many readers, possibly, the name
of Tibet calls up but a vague and
shadowy image of a sort of eastern
Lapland, which serves as a top-margin
to the map of Hindostan, and produces
lamas, generally understood to
be a species of shawl goats from
whose fleece the Messrs Nicol make
world-renowned paletôts. Our purpose,
then, is to define our ideas of the
region called Tibet, and to gather together
as we may, from old and new
sources, some picture more or less
dim and fragmentary of the land and
its inhabitants.</p>

Frenchman. Not Tweed, but the
Grampians, have marked in our
native land the marches of Celt and
Saxon. On the side of the Five
Rivers the Indian population shades
gradually from the true Hindoo into
the shaggy robber of the valleys west
of the Indus; at the extremity of the
peninsula the Tamul tribes of the continent
have peopled the coast of
Ceylon, as the ancient Belgæ peopled
the coast of Kent. But along the
northern limit of India runs a barrier
which,</p>

<p>dividing the Caucasian from the

it did two or three thousand years

<p>From the plains of the Punjab,
hard baked beneath the blazing May
sun&mdash;from the dusty levels of Sirhind,
where meagre acacias cheat the eye

lines of thatched pyramids that greet
the traveller in the Doab, as he
approaches a British cantonment&mdash;eastward
through the rich misgoverned
tracts of populous Oude, that
year by year pour forth their streams
of stalwart soldiers, servants, and
labourers, to push their fortune in the
service of the Kumpanee Buhadoor
or its representatives&mdash;still eastward
from the fertile prairies of Tirhoot
and Purneea&mdash;from the bamboo
thickets and rice swamps of northern
Bengal&mdash;yet far eastward from the
<em>ultima Thule</em> of Anglo-Indian power,
where the majestic flood of Burrampooter
sweeps down into Assam from
the unknown hills&mdash;from all these</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dusk faces with white muslin turbans
wreathed"</p></blockquote>

<p>look northward through the clear
morning air on the same mighty Himalaya,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
stretching beyond their ken
its awful barrier of unchanging snow.</p>

<p>In mounting from the plains of
India over the arduous passes, ranging
from 12,000 to 20,000 feet above
the sea, through which the pressure of
human need, curiosity, and superstition,
has forced a scanty and intermittent
stream of intercourse, the
traveller, after traversing the last
ridge of the Himalaya, instead of
having to descend again to the level
of the southern regions, finds himself
but little raised above a vast table-land,
in some places extending in
barren wastes of plain, or of bare
monotonous hills, intersected by sudden
deep valleys or great ravines, in
which the rivers flow and the few
villages are scattered; in others forming
an endless alternation of lofty
mountain ranges and low valleys, but
the bottom of these last still many
thousand feet above the plains of the
Indian peninsula. To this elevated region,
stretching from the Indus north-west
of Kashmeer, to the extremest
point of Assam, and somewhat farther
east, a space of more than 1500 miles,
the name of Tibet applies. The limits
of its extent northward are somewhat
more vague; but if they be considered
to include a breadth of three or
four degrees of latitude (33°-36°)
towards the western extremity, and
of nine or ten degrees (28°-38°) in
the eastern and widest part, the estimate
will not be far wrong. The
identity throughout this "very large
and long countrey," (to borrow the
expression of an old traveller,) consists
in the general use of the same
language and customs, the prevalence,
except in the extreme west, of the
same faith, and the possession of
the same religious books, written or
printed in a character common to all.
To these we might perhaps add the
domestication of the shawl-goat and
the yak throughout the whole territory.</p>

<p>The name of Tibet does not appear
to be known, or at least applied, either
in the country itself or by its Hindoo
neighbours. Tubbet, or Tobot, is
stated to have been the Mongolian
appellation of a nation who anciently
occupied the mountainous country on
the north-west confines of China.
Our old travellers doubtless learned
the word from the Mongols; and from
them also it has been adopted as the
name of the high country north of
India, in all the Mussulman languages
of Western Asia. It was more particularly,
perhaps, applied in these to
Balti and Ladakh, the two most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
westerly districts, which, in the time
of Bernier, were commonly distinguished
as Little and Great Tibet.
The natives apply to their country
the name of Bód or Pót, and as Bhoteeas
they are themselves known in
Hindostan; though the appellation of
Bhotan has in our geography-books
come to be confined to a small dependency
of Tibet bordering on the
north of Assam, where the race comes
most closely in contact with our
knowledge and the British power,
just as our forefathers gave the title of
Dutch specially to that fraction of the
Teutonic or <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutsch</i> race which most
nearly adjoined their shores.</p>

<p>The central and most elevated portion
of this region is the province of
Ngari&mdash;called by the people of the
adjoining British territory <i>Hyundes</i>,
or "Snowland." It embraces extensive
desert tracts, intersected by
several lofty ranges, the chief being
that of Kylass, the sacred celestial
mountain of Indian mythology. The
table-land at the foot of Kylass, on
which lie the twin lakes of Rákas Thal
and Manasaráwur, at a height of
15,250 feet above the sea, is probably
the most elevated in Asia, or in the
world. On the shores of these sacred
lakes occurred, some years ago, the
catastrophe of a curious historical
episode. Zorawur Singh, commanding
the troops, of Goolab Singh of
Jummoo, (now well known as the
Lord of Kashmeer,) after overrunning
Little Tibet and subjugating Ladakh,
advanced up the Indus and beyond
it, till he had occupied posts on the
frontier of the Nepalese Himalayas, as
if he meditated a foray on the Grand
Lama's capital at last. But it proved
a Moscow expedition on a small scale.
His troops, unused to such a climate,
and straitened for fuel, were beset in
the depth of winter by a superior force
from Lhassa, and, helpless from cold,
were overpowered: their leader was
slain, their officers captured, and the
mass perished in heaps miserably. A
few poor, frost-maimed wretches&mdash;the
sole relics of Zorawur Singh's
adventurous band&mdash;brought the tale
to the British station at Almora,
having fled across passes 16,000 feet
high in mid-winter. The bleak aspect
of the Tibetan plain, as seen from
the pass of Niti, somewhat westward
of the lakes&mdash;shrubless, treeless,
houseless&mdash;is compared by a traveller
to the dreary moors of Upper Clydesdale,
with stone and scanty brown
herbage in the place of heather. Some
of the most celebrated rivers in the
world have their not unworthy source
in the lofty table which forms the
base of the Hindoo Olympus. The
Ganges rises in the mountains immediately
adjoining Ngari on the south-west,
the Gogra, which, were size alone
to decide the rights of river nomenclature,
might perhaps claim the Ganges
as a tributary, has its source in Ngari;
so have the Indus, the Sutlej, and the
Sanpoo. The Sanpoo, after flowing
eastward behind the Himalayan range
for some eight hundred miles, is lost
to geography in the untraversed regions
south-east of Lhassa. In the
last century, D'Anville identified the
Sanpoo with the Irawaddy, flowing
through the whole extent of the Burman
Empire to the sea at Rangoon;
but the sagacity of Rennel suggested
that the Burrampooter, emerging from
unexplored mountains into the valley
of Assam, and bearing to the sea a
flood of waters greatly exceeding the
Ganges, is the true Sanpoo. Turner,
who, in his mission, reached the banks
of the Sanpoo, indicates its course
from the information of the Lamas in
entire coincidence with Rennel's view.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
In later years, however, Klaproth has
revived the theory of D'Anville, apparently
without good grounds. The
Dihong, which is the principal contributor
to the Burrampooter in Assam,
though its course above the plains
remains unexplored, bursts on our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
knowledge with a stream of such capacity
as quite justifies the length
attributed to it by the supposition
that it is identical with the Sanpoo.
And there seems little reason to doubt
that the two great rivers, Ganges and
Sanpoo, rising from the same lofty
region, within 150 miles of one another,
after diverging to an interval
of some 17° of longitude, combine their
waters in the plains of Bengal. In
Rennel's time, the Burrampooter, after
issuing westward from the Assam
valley, swept south and south-eastward,
and, forming with the Ganges a
fluvial peninsula, entered the sea
abreast of that river below Dacca.
And so almost all English maps persist
in representing it, though this
eastern channel is now, unless in
the rainy season, shallow and insignificant;
the vast body of the Burrampooter
cutting across the neck
of the peninsula under the name of
Jenai, and uniting with the Ganges
near Pubna (about 150 miles north-east
of Calcutta), from which point the
two rivers, under the local name of
Pudda, flow on in mighty union to
the sea.</p>

<p>The upper part of the Indus valley,
with the adjoining pastures, bears
the name of <i>Chanthan</i>, or the <i>Northern
Plains</i>, and produces the finest
shawl wool. The export of this was
long almost monopolised by the Ladakh
market for the supply of Kashmeer,
but much of it now finds its
way direct to British India by the
Sutlej valley and more eastern passes.
The population is most scanty, and
partially nomadic&mdash;the names which
dot it on the map being mostly mere
shepherd shelters, or clusters of nomad
tents round a few houses of
sunburnt brick. Tashigong, the only
place of any extent, is the site of an
important monastery. North of the
Indus, and separated from it by a
range of mountains, is the extensive
salt lake of Pangkung. On the Singhkhabab,
or Indus, farther westward,
are strung, as it were, the principalities
of Ladakh and Balti. These consist
of a mass of mountain ranges
rising from a base elevated 11,000 feet
and more above the sea. This rugged
country occupies the whole breadth
of the Indus drainage from the Kashmeer
Himalyas to the Karakoram
mountains. The levels along the
borders of the streams, and the slopes
at the bases of the mountains, are
diligently cultivated and irrigated,
being first formed into terraced steps
by a great accumulation of patient
labour&mdash;a practice that prevails
through the whole extent of the
Himalaya Mountains. The uncultivated
part of the country has the
usual Tibetan aspect of bleakness and
sterility.</p>

<p>Balti, or Little Tibet, is still independent
under various chieftains, of
whom the most powerful resides at
Skardo, a considerable village, doing
duty for a city where cities are so
scarce. Ladakh was conquered by the
Sikh feudatory, Goolab Singh, in 1835;
and after the Sutlej victories of 1846,
possession was confirmed to him by
Lord Hardinge, at the same time
that Kashmeer was made over to his
tender mercies. Le, the capital, and
probably the only aggregation of
dwellings worthy of the name of
town, situated in the valley of the
Indus, and containing from 700 to
1000 houses, had before that period
been visited by only two or three
Europeans, of whom the persistent
and unfortunate Moorcroft was the
first in this century. Captain H.
Strachey, of the Bengal army, belonging
to the commission appointed to
define the boundary between Ladakh
and the Chinese or Tibetan dependencies,
spent several years, between
1846 and 1849, in those regions; and
far more accurate and full information
than has ever yet been obtained
may be expected from his researches.
The whole population of Balti, and a
half in Ladakh, are Sheea Mahommedans.</p>

<p>Returning to the centre of the table-land,
we have, on the north-east of
Ngari, extensive and almost unknown
deserts, containing numerous salt-lakes,
and haunted by a scanty nomad
population, called by the Tibetans
<i>Sok</i>, and supposed to represent the
ancient Sacians. South-east lie the
provinces of U and Tsang, or, conjointly,
U-Tsang, to which the natives
specially apply the name of Bód, and
which may be considered as Tibet
Proper. It is that part of the region
to which we turn with most curiosity
and interest, as containing the centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
of spiritual and chief political supremacy&mdash;Lhassa,
so long the unreachable
Timbuctoo of the East. Lhassa is
situated in the province of U, on a
northern tributary of the Sanpoo, by
which it is separated from Tsang.
The latter territory is immediately
governed by the Teshoo Lama, the
potentate with whom we made an
accidental acquaintance in Warren
Hastings' time&mdash;our first and last
brief but cordial intercourse with
Tibet Proper. The provinces of U-Tsang
are intersected by lofty alpine
ranges, which, as they trend east
and south-east, converge, but without
uniting, insomuch that, in the
inexpressibly rugged country where
the frontiers of Tibet, Burma, and
China approach one another, we
find four parallel valleys traversed by
four of the greatest rivers of Asia,
embraced within the narrow space of
one hundred miles. The Tibetan
portion of this wild region, known as
<i>Kham</i>, is inhabited by a rough race,
of warlike and independent character,
retaining many primitive superstitions
beneath the engrafted Lamanism,
and treating with little respect
the Chinese pretensions to sovereignty.
Through this region the missionaries
Huc and Gabet were escorted
back to China&mdash;the first Europeans,
there can be little doubt, who ever
trod those wilds. The plundering
excursions of the Kham-pa extend all
across the breadth of Tibet, and the
fear of them haunts even the pilgrims
to Kylass and the Manusaráwur
Lake.</p>

<p>The Bhotan territory remains,
which, from language, religion, manners,
and political connection, may
justly be considered as Tibetan, though
occupying not the table-land north
of the Himalaya, but the whole breadth
of the range itself, from the Tsang
country to Assam. Bhotan is a mass
of mountains clothed in perpetual
verdure, its slopes covered with forests
of large and lofty trees; populous
villages, girt with orchards, are scattered
along the sides and summits of
the spurs; every declivity of favourable
aspect is carved into terraces,
cultivated to the utmost, and carefully
irrigated from the abundant streams.
Nothing could be physically in greater
contrast with the bleak and arid plains
or rocky hills of Tibet. The people
of Bhotan are a remarkably fine race.
Scarcely anywhere else in the world
shall we find an equal proportion
of men so straight, so well made,
and so athletic, many of them more
than six feet high. Deformity is
almost unknown, except that arising
from goitre, which is very prevalent
among them, as it is, indeed, over the
whole extent of the Himalaya, and of
the Turaee, or forest tract, at the base
of the mountains; whilst Tibet Proper
is entirely free from it. Tibetan geographers,
according to Csoma de Körös,
compare Ngari, with its fountains, to
a tank, U-Tsang to the irrigating channels,
and Kham to the field irrigated.
We do not appreciate the aptness of
the similitude. More intelligibly,
European geographers have likened
Tibet in form to a vast cornucopia
pouring from its wide eastern mouth
vast rivers forth, to fertilise the happier
plains of China, Siam, Burma,
and Assam.</p>

<p>All these countries, with the exception
of Little Tibet, or Balti, and of
Ladakh since its seizure by the Sikhs,
acknowledge more or less directly
the supremacy of the Dalai Lama at
Lhassa, and, beyond him, that of
China. Since the accession of the
existing Manchoo dynasty to the
throne of Pekin, they have always
maintained two envoys at the court
of Lhassa. Mr Prinsep aptly compares
the position of these ministers
to that of a British resident at the
court of Luknow or Hyderabad. They
do not, however, appear to meddle
much with the ordinary internal administration,
nor is their military
force maintained in the country large.
Besides a few hundred men at Lhassa,
and guards established at intervals
on the post-road from China, they
take upon them the superintendence
of the passes of the Himalaya, and
see to the exclusion of Europeans
by those inlets with unrelaxing rigour.
In other parts of Tibet there are no
Chinese.</p>

<p>The whole of this country, though
so near the tropic, is the coldest and
bleakest inhabited by a civilised
people on the surface of the earth, if
we except Siberia. Forests of cedar,
holly, and other Himalayan trees, are
met with in the valleys of the extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
east, bordering upon China. Lhassa
is surrounded with trees of considerable
size; and a few straggling
willows or poplars, artfully pollarded
for the multiplication of their
staves, are found by the watercourses
of Ladakh and Tibet Proper; but the
vast extent of the table-land is bare
and desolate, and as devoid of trees
as Shetland. The ancient Hindoos
are said to have esteemed it as a
vault over hell. The only shrubs
that dot the waste are the Tartaric
furze, or the wizened wormwood,
with its white parched stalks, or perchance,
in more favoured spots, a few
stunted rose-bushes. Though the
winter is long and severe, snow is
not frequent in the valleys. The
air is of a purity and brilliance which
dazzles and fatigues the eye, and its
excessive dryness produces effects
analogous to those of the scorching
May winds in the torrid plains of
Hindostan;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">"The parching air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burns frore, and cold performs the effect<br /></span>
<span class="i4">of fire;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">vegetation is dried to brittleness,
and leaves may be rubbed between
the fingers into dust. Mahogany
chests, and furniture belonging to
Turner's party, which had stood the
climate of Bengal for years, warped
and split under the cold dry winds of
Tibet. Wood seems subject to no
other cause of injury from time.</p>

<p>As might be expected, tillage is
scanty, and the population depend
much on imported food. Villages
are small, seldom containing more
than twenty houses. These, in the
better parts of the country, have a
cheerful appearance, the dwellings
being all white-washed, with doors
and windows picked out in red or
yellow. Lhassa would seem to be
the only city of Tibet worthy of
that title: the Chinese geographers,
indeed, and native itineraries, speak
of one or two others, but nothing is
known of them. Teshoo Loombo on
the Sanpoo, ten days from Lhassa,
though the residence of the second
personage in Tibet, seems to be
merely a monastic establishment.
Indeed, the large convents are probably,
after Lhassa, the most considerable
nuclei of population in the
country; and Lhassa itself has perhaps
grown to importance as an
appendage to the Potála, or residence
of the Grand Lama.</p>

<p>No European traveller has described
this celebrated city before
M. Huc, and we cannot say that he
succeeds in bringing its aspect before
his readers very vividly. When
within a day's journey of the city,
one of the most rugged mountain
passes of the many which the missionaries
had met with, in their journey
from the east of Tartary, still intervened.
"The sun was about to set
as we completed our descent of the
innumerable zigzags of the mountain
path. Issuing into a wide valley, we
beheld on our right Lhassa, the famous
metropolis of the Buddhistic
world. The multitude of aged trees,
which encircle the city as with a
girdle of foliage&mdash;the lofty white
houses, terminating in flat roofs surrounded
by turrets&mdash;the numerous
temples, with their gilded canopies&mdash;the
Boodhala, crowned by the palace
of the Dalai Lama&mdash;all unite to give
Lhassa a majestic and imposing appearance."
The city is stated to be
nearly two leagues in circumference,
and it is now without walls. Outside
the suburbs are numerous gardens
planted with the large trees mentioned
above. The main streets are wide,
well laid-out, and tolerably clean in
dry weather; but the dirt of the suburbs
is unspeakable. The houses,
which are large, and several stories
high, are whitewashed, according to
universal Tibetan custom, the doors
and windows being bordered in red
or yellow. M. Huc does not enter
into any detail of their architecture,
but we may suppose that these houses
are analogous in character to what is
seen in other parts of Tibet. The lower
part of a house presents lofty dead
walls, pierced only by two or three
air-holes; above these are from one
to half-a-dozen tiers of windows with
projecting balconies, and, over all,
flat, broad-brimmed roofs, at a variety
of levels; add to this, that the houses
run into one another so strangely that
it is difficult to determine the extent
of each mansion, and that the groups
of building generally contract in extent
as they rise. On the whole, we
may conceive a Tibetan city like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
cluster of card-houses of various altitudes.
In the suburbs of Lhassa there
is one quarter entirely built of the
horns of sheep and oxen set in mortar.
The construction is solid, and
the effect highly picturesque, the varied
colour and texture of the two
species facilitating the production of
a great variety of patterns. Lhassa
bustles with the continual traffic of
crowds attracted by commerce or devotion
from all parts of Asia, and
presents an astonishing variety of
physiognomy, costume, and language.</p>

<p>Less than a mile north of the town
a conical craggy hill rises like an
island from the middle of the wide
valley. On this hill, Potala, (the
name of which M. Huc writes Boodhala,
and interprets, questionably,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> to
mean "Mount of Buddha,") is the
residence of the Tibetan flesh-and-blood
divinity. It is a great cluster
of temples and other buildings, terminating
in a lofty four-storied edifice
towering over the others, crowned by
a dome or canopy entirely covered
with gold, and encircled by a range
of gilded columns. From this lofty
sanctuary the great Lama may contemplate
on festival days the crowds
of his adorers moving in the plain,
and prostrating themselves at the foot
of the holy hill. The subordinate
buildings of this acropolis serve as
residences to a crowd of Lamas of all
ranks, who form the court and permanent
attendants of the sacred sovereign.
Two avenues lined with trees
lead from the city to the Potala,
generally thronged with mounted
lamas of the court, and with pilgrims
from a distance, who, as they move
along, thread their long rosaries, and
mutter the sacred symbol of their
faith. The crowds around the Potala
are in continual motion, but generally
grave and silent, as if in religious abstraction.
It is probably etiquette to
be so.</p>

<p>Unfortunately our missionaries have
ventured on no graphic illustrations;
and the only attempt that we know of
to delineate this interesting citadel of
Buddhism, is a plate contained in the
narrative of Grueber and Dorville's
journey, given by Athanasius Kircher
in his <cite>China Illustrata</cite>. It is meagre
enough, but yet looks genuine, and not
a mere Amsterdam concoction.</p>

<p>A singular legend is stated by Huc
to exist, both at Lhassa and among
the dwellers by the Koko-Noor, (the
great salt lake on the north-east frontier
of Tibet,) that the waters of that
basin formerly occupied a subterraneous
site beneath the capital city; but,
on the breaking of a charm which detained
them there, they passed off
under ground, and flooded the valley
where the lake now exists. It is curious
that Turner met with a version
of this same tradition on the southern
frontier of Tibet; but there it was
related that Buddha, in compassion
to the few and wretched creatures
who then inhabited the land, drew off
the waters through Bengal. A similar
tradition regarding the valley of
Katmandoo exists in Nepaul.</p>

<p>The people of Tibet are of the great
Mongolian family, and exhibit its
characters in a very marked degree;&mdash;platter
face, with prominent cheek-bones,
button-hole eyes and upright
eyelids, squashed nose, wide mouth,
retiring chin, scant beard, coarse black
hair, deeply-marked and weather-beaten
countenances; naturally of a
pale-brown colour, but tanned to any
depth of copper, not without a ruddy
tint at times; of a considerable variety
of stature. The English traveller
who, in traversing the steep valley-sides
of the Himalaya, comes for the
first time on a party of Tibetans driving
southward their flock of sheep and
goats&mdash;each little quadruped, like a
camel from Lilliput, laden with some
twenty pounds of salt or borax&mdash;is
struck at once with the idea that he
has stumbled on a group of Esquimaux
out of Parry's voyages. These
quaint, good-humoured people frequent
the fairs of the British hill-territory,
to exchange their salt for wheat
and barley; and sometimes they get
so far from home as to astonish, with
unwonted apparition, the evening promenaders
at Simla or Mussooree.</p>

<p>These uncouth peasants, though
perhaps the best ethnographic studies,
are not to be taken as samples of the
culture and refinement of Tibet. The
higher classes of the country have
only been known to those few travellers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
who have penetrated to the
capitals&mdash;Ladakh on the one side,
Lhassa and Teshoo Loombo on the
other. All these seem to have been
most favourably impressed with the
kindly and simple, but by no means
unpolished manners of the educated
class; the plain and unaffected language,
the mild and unassuming demeanour,
of the ruling prince at
Teshoo Loombo&mdash;which Turner, at
the same time, says was characteristic
of all well-educated Tibetans&mdash;fully
accords with the character of the
regent-minister at Lhassa, as he
appears in the later narrative of
M. Huc.</p>

<p>Dark woollen cloth is the standard
material of dress, formed into a wide
frock, trousers, and leggings, the last
replaced in the wealthy by boots of
Russia, or other costly leather.
Over all is worn a capacious mantle
of cloth, sometimes lined with fur.
From a red girdle depend various
purses, containing the wooden teacup
inseparable from a Tibetan, flint and
steel, and other odds and ends. Gay
broad-brimmed hats are in vogue at
Lhassa, but are rarer in the west.
The women dress much like the men,
and plait the hair in narrow tresses
hanging on the shoulders. On the top
of the head the Ladakh women wear a
flat lappet of cloth or leather, descending
in a peak behind, stuck over with
beads of turquoise, amber, and cornelian;
and the back hair is gathered in
a queue, which is lengthened by tassels
of coloured worsted intermixed with
shells, bells, and coins, until it nearly
touches the ground. Though not
veiled, like the Moslem women, with
muslin or calico, their charms are
subjected to a much more efficacious
disguise. Before leaving home, every
respectable woman at Lhassa plasters
her face with a black sticky varnish
like raspberry jam, which gives her an
aspect scarcely human. The practice
is said at Lhassa to have been introduced
some centuries ago, in order to
check the immorality which was then
rampant in the city. But it appears
to be widely diffused, and is probably
ancient. Rubruquis refers to something
like it in the thirteenth century.
Grueber and Dorville, who travelled
through Tibet and Nepaul in 1661,
say, "The women of these kingdoms
are so hideous that they are liker
demons than human creatures; for
through some superstition, instead of
water they always use a stinking oil
to wash with; and with this they are
so fetid and so bedaubed that they
might be taken for hateful hobgoblins."
But tastes differ, and the same
unguent which the missionaries represent
as intended to render the women
hideously unattractive, or at least a
modification of it in fashion at Ladakh,
Moorcroft appears to think is adopted
as a cosmetic. From all the fathers
could learn, the black varnish has not
altogether reformed Tibetan morals.</p>

<p>The strange, repulsive custom of
<em>polyandry</em>, or the marriage of one
woman to several brothers, is diffused
over the greater part of Tibet, though
it is not mentioned by Huc as existing
at Lhassa. It is not confined to
the lower ranks, but is frequent also
in opulent families. Turner mentions
one instance in the neighbourhood of
Teshoo Loombo, where <em>five</em> brothers
were living together very happily
under the same connubial compact.</p>

<p>Moorcroft speaks of three meals
a-day as the practise of Ladakh, but
this extraordinary symptom of civilisation
does not seem to be general.
In Eastern Tibet, regular meals are
not in vogue; the members of a family
do not assemble to dine together,
but "eat when they're hungry, drink
when they're dry." We remember to
have heard a graphic description of
the Tibetan cuisine from a humourous
<em>shikaree</em>, or native Nimrod, of our
Himalayan provinces. "The Bhoteea
folk," he said, "have a detestable
way of eating. They take a large
cooking-pot full of water, and put in
it meat, bread, rice, what not, and
set it on the fire, where it is always
a-simmering. When hungry, they go
and fish out a cupful of whatever
comes uppermost, perhaps six or
seven times a-day. Strangers are
served in the same way. If a man
gets hold of a bone, he picks it, wipes
his hands on his dress, and chucks it
back into the pot; so with all crumbs
and scraps, back they go into the
pot, and thus the never-ending, still
beginning mess stews on."</p>

<p>Tea, however, is a staple article of
diet, and is served on all occasions.
A vast quantity is imported, artificially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
compressed into the form of solid
bricks of about eight pounds weight,
in which shape it requires little packing,
and forms a most handy article
for barter. Instead of infusing it
after our fashion, they pulverise a
piece of the brick and boil it in water,
with a proportion of salt and soda;
then churn it up with a quantity of
butter, and serve the mess in a teapot.
At Tassisudon, Turner admired the
dexterity (comparable to that of a
London waiter manipulating a bottle
of soda-water) with which the raja's
attendant, before serving the liquid,
"giving a circular turn to the teapot,
so as to agitate and mix its contents,
poured a quantity into the palm of
his hand, which he had contracted to
form as deep a concave as possible,
and hastily sipped it up." When
taken as a meal, <i>tsamba</i>, or the flour
of parched barley, is added, each man
mixing his own cupful up into a sort
of brose or gruel with his five natural
<em>spatulæ</em>. Meat is abundant, but is
taken as an extra or embellishment,
rather than as a staple of diet. In
cookery, the people appear to have
none of the genius of their neighbours,
either of India or of China. Hares,
winged game, and fish, though abundant,
are not eaten, so that they
have scarcely any meat but mutton,
(excepting occasionally yak beef,) and
their mutton they have but three ways
of serving&mdash;viz., absolutely raw,
frozen, and boiled. The frozen meat
having been prepared in winter may
then be kept throughout the year,
and carried to any part of Tibet.
European travellers generally commend
this meat, which undergoes no
process of cookery.</p>

<p>The Tibetans, being no great water-drinkers,
the liquid next in importance
to tea is an acidulous beverage
made from fermented barley, known
through more than 20° of longitude
as <i>chong</i>. Turner absurdly calls it
whisky, but it is rather analogous to
beer. It requires a large quantity to
produce intoxication, but, nevertheless,
that result <em>is</em> attained.</p>

<p>One of the peculiar customs which
prominently mark the whole Tibetan
race is the use of the <i>khata</i>, or scarf of
ceremony. This is a fringed scarf of
Chinese silk gauze, which is interchanged
on all occasions of ceremonious
intercourse, even the most trivial,
and in every rank of society. They are
to be had of qualities and prices suited
to all pockets, and no Tibetan travels
without a stock of them. In paying
formal visits, in asking a favour, or returning
thanks for one, in offering a
present or delivering a message to a
superior, the <i>khata</i> is presented. On
the meeting of friends after long separation,
the first care is to exchange
the <i>khata</i>. In epistolary correspondence,
also, it is customary to enclose
the <i>khata</i>; without it, the finest words
and most magnificent presents are of
no account. Turner mentions that
the Bhotan Raja once returned a letter
of the Governor-General's, because it
was unaccompanied by this bulky but
polite incumbrance.</p>

<p>Of all the quaint modes of salutation
among men, that in fashion at
Lhassa is surely the quaintest and
most elaborate; and we can fancy that
it affords room for all the graces of a
Tibetan Chesterfield. It consists in
uncovering the head, sticking out the
tongue, and scratching the right ear!
and these three operations are performed
simultaneously.</p>

<p>Tibet has always been a subject of
curiosity, not more from its inaccessibility
than from the singular nature
of its government, resting, as is well
known, in the hands of a sovereign,
elective under a singular and superstitious
system, who, by the name of
Dalai (<em>the ocean</em>) Lama, is not only
king and spiritual father, but also the
embodied divinity of his people. The
Buddhistic faith, numbering as its
adherents a greater population than
any other existing creed, when driven
from its native soil, India, (in which
it has long been totally extinct, though
its gigantic footsteps still mark the
surface in all parts of the peninsula,)
spread over Nepaul, Ceylon, the kingdoms
of the Transgangetic Peninsula,
China, Corea, Japan, Tibet, and the
whole Mongolian region to the confines
of Siberia. The essential idea
of Buddhism appears to be a peculiar
development of the notion which runs
through nearly all the Asiatic pagan
philosophies, and which, interwoven
with the fantasies of the innumerable
Gnostic sects, once spread its influence
to the centre of the Christian
world&mdash;viz., that all the external world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
is but a transient manifestation of the
Divine Being, and the souls of all living
creatures are emanations from
Him; that these souls, whilst included
in material and perishable bodies, are
in a state of imperfection, degradation,
and suffering; and that the great
object of intelligent creatures should
be final release from the clog of the
flesh, and abdication of all personal
identity, to be absorbed in the universal
soul. Considerable difference
of opinion exists among the learned
as to the true epoch of Sakya Muni
or Gautama, the Indian deified saint,
or <i>Buddha</i>, who was the propagator
of the doctrine in the particular form
which derives its appellation from
him; but the latest of the various
periods assigned for his death is 543
<small>B.C.</small> After a long life spent in preaching
humility, self-denial, meditation
on the divine perfections, and the
celebration of solemn ritual services
of praise and worship, he is believed
himself to have been, at death, absorbed
into the divine essence on account of
his great attainments in sanctity.
Sakya was followed by a succession
of sacred personages, who are to be
regarded either as mortals whose
attainments in sanctity have reached,
in repeated transmigrations, to a
divine eminence, though not yet to
the final absorption of a Buddha, or
as voluntary incarnations of souls
whose virtue <em>had</em> attained to freedom
from the necessity of renewed terrestrial
life, but who chose to dwell
again on earth in order to aid men in
the attainment of perfection, and facilitate
their reunion with the universal
soul. It is this part of the system
which has assumed an exaggerated
prominence in Tibet and Mongolia,
where these regenerations have gradually,
in the general faith, taken the
form of continual and manifold incarnations
of Buddha, or the Divine
Being.</p>

<p>In combination with this doctrine,
and the stress laid on meditation and
ritual worship, a vast proportion of
the inhabitants, both in Tibet and
Mongolia, one at least out of every
family where there are more than one
son, devote themselves to a religious
life, and many of these dwell together
in monastic communities. The Shabrongs
or Regenerate Buddhas are so
numerous that many of the chief convents
possess one. These personages,
though all esteemed divine, appear
somehow to vary in spiritual consideration
as well as temporal grandeur,
as one Marian idol in the Church
of Rome has more sanctity and miraculous
power ascribed to it than another
has. The most eminent and
most venerated of all is the Dalai
Lama. The exercise of his authority
is in theory unlimited; he is the
centre of all government. But since,
in the capacity of manifested divinity,
he could not, without derogation of his
sacred character, mix himself up with
the numerous trivialities of human
affairs, few questions are actually submitted
to him; he is regarded only in
the most amiable light, as absorbed
in religious duty, or interfering only
to exercise the most benign attributes.
The general administration of the
government is carried on by another
personage, also a Shabrong, nominated
by the supreme Lama, and known as
the <i>Nomé-Khan</i>; by the Chinese and
the Western Tibetans, he is generally
called King of Tibet Proper. The
Nomé-Khan is appointed for life, and
can only be removed by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-d'état</i>.
He is assisted in administration by
four lay ministers called <i>Kalongs</i>.</p>

<p>The provinces are governed by
ecclesiastical princes receiving their
investiture from the Dalai Lama, and
acknowledging his supremacy, but
enjoying apparently a good deal of
practical independence.</p>

<p>The most important of these princes,
and in spiritual estimation but little
below the Dalai Lama himself, is the
Punjun Rimboochee of Jachee (or
Teshoo) Loombo, known to the
British in India as Teshoo Lama.
The intercourse between the Anglo-Indian
Government and this prince
arose as follows:&mdash;In 1772 the Deb
Raja, or sovereign of Bhotan, laid
claim to and seized Kooch Bahar, a
district at the mouth of the Assam
Valley, adjoining Rungpoor. A sepoy
force was sent to expel the hill people,
which they speedily accomplished,
pursuing the enemy to their mountains.
The raja, alarmed for his own
dominions, applied for the intercession
of Teshoo Lama, who was then regent,
spiritual, and political, of the
whole of Tibet, during the minority of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
the Lhassa pontiff. The Lama sent a
deputation to Calcutta, with a letter
to Warren Hastings, then Governor&mdash;"an
authentic and curious specimen,"
says Turner, "of his good sense,
humility, simplicity of heart, and,
above all, of that delicacy of sentiment
and expression which could convey a
threat in terms of meekness and supplication."
The deputation, and the
presents which it bore from a country
so mysterious and inaccessible, excited
intense interest at Calcutta&mdash;the
Governor at once acceded to the
Lama's intercession, and determined
to take advantage of the opportunity
afforded to acquire knowledge of
those obscure regions, and to find,
possibly, new outlets to British commerce,
under circumstances so favourable
and unlooked for. He
accordingly despatched Mr George
Bogle, a civilian, with presents and
specimens of articles of trade. Bogle
started in May 1774. There was a
good deal of delay and difficulty made
on the part of the Tibetan government
about granting him a passport;
and it was not till October that he
arrived at the residence of the Lama.
The two seem, during Bogle's visit,
which continued till April 1775, completely
to have gained each other's
confidence and good-will. The Englishman,
on his return, always spoke of
the Lama as one of the most able and
intelligent men he had ever known,
maintaining his rank with the utmost
mildness of authority, and living in the
greatest purity and simplicity of manners.
Turner, whose mission will be
mentioned presently, found these
praises confirmed by the very strong
and unusual impression of regard which
the sovereign's gentleness and benevolence
had left among his subjects.
On the other hand, the Lama showed
his confidence in Bogle, by remitting
to him some time after a considerable
sum of money, to be expended in the
erection of a temple and dwelling-house
on the banks of the Hoogly,
for the use of his votaries in Bengal.
The characteristic reason assigned for
this wish was, that during the numerous
series of the Lama's regenerations,
Bengal was the only country in which
he had been born twice. In 1779,
when the Lama, after repeated invitations,
visited Pekin, he, in the same
friendly spirit, requested Mr Bogle to
go round to Canton, promising to
obtain the Emperor's permission for
his proceeding to the capital. This
singular tryst came to nothing in consequence
of the death of the Lama
at Pekin&mdash;in accordance with a fatality
which seldom spares the vassal princes
of Central Asia on their visits to the
Chinese court&mdash;and that of Mr Bogle
himself about the same time. The
brother and minister of Teshoo Lama
communicated the circumstances in
letters to Mr Hastings, stating that
they were in continual prayer for the
accomplishment of the transmigration;
and, soon after intelligence of
this important event was received,
the governor sent a renewed deputation
as bearers of congratulations, in
which (in the lax Anglo-Indian spirit
of that age) the continued identity
of the Lama was fully recognised.
The result of Captain Samuel Turner's
mission, as regarded the establishment
of commercial intercourse
with Tibet, was nothing, but it obtained
for us at least a very interesting
and valuable book. Turner had
the privilege of an interview with the
young Lama, at that time past
eighteen mouths old; and as the
occasion was unique of its kind, we
abstract his account of it. The envoy
found the infant placed in great form
on an elevated mound, covered with
embroidered silk; on the left stood
the child's father and mother, on the
right the officer specially appointed
to wait on him. Turner, advancing,
presented a white scarf, and put into
the Lama's hands the Governor-General's
present of a string of pearls
and coral. The other things were set
down before him, and having then exchanged
scarfs with the father and
mother, the Englishmen took their
seats on the Lama's right. The
infant turned towards them, and
received them with a cheerful look
of complacency. "During the time
we were in the room," says Turner,
"I observed that the Lama's eyes
were scarcely ever turned from us,
and when our cups were empty of
tea he appeared uneasy, and, throwing
back his head, and contracting
the skin of his brow, continued to
make a noise, for he could not speak,
until they were filled again. He took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
some burnt sugar out of a golden cup
containing confectionary and, stretching
out his arm, made a motion to his
attendant to give it to me. He sent
some in like manner to Mr Saunders,
who was with me." Turner then
made him a speech, expressing the
Governor-General's grief at hearing of
his decease in China, and his joy at
the news of his reappearance; his
hope that their former friendship might
be increased, and that there might
be extensive communication between
his votaries and British subjects.
"The little creature turned, looking
steadfastly towards me with the
appearance of much attention while
I spoke, and nodded with repeated
but slow movements of the head, as
though he understood and approved
every word, but could not utter a reply....
His whole attention was
directed to us; I must own that
his behaviour on this occasion appeared
perfectly natural and spontaneous,
and not directed by any
external action or sign of authority."</p>

<p>The existing Punjun or Teshoo
Lama is described by Huc from report,
in 1816, as a man of about sixty years
of age. It is, therefore, very probable
that he is the same person who
was seen by Turner in infancy; and if
so, he has fulfilled the promise of
mark, then precociously exhibited.
He has great fame throughout Tibet
and all Tartary, his partisans claiming
for him spiritual power at least
equal to that of the Dalai Lama, and
never naming him without deep
reverence. His influence has waxed
the more from the fact that three
successive Dalai Lamas have perished
before attaining majority. He is said
to be of majestic port, and surprising
vigour for his age. All pilgrims to
the holy sites of Tibet visit Jachee
Loombo, and, after making their
offerings to the Teshoo, are enrolled
in the brotherhood of Gylongs instituted
by him, of which all Tartar
Buddhists aspire to be members, and
which, doubtless, will one day play
an important part in the history of
that part of Asia. The votaries of
Teshoo Lama are satisfied that he is
acquainted with all languages, and
converses with the pilgrims of all
countries, "each in the tongue in
which he was born." His predecessor,
Panjun Irtinnee, being a native of
Ladakh, was able to converse with
Mr Bogle in Hindustanee, and as the
bystanders believed their unknown
language to be English, this strongly
confirmed their belief in the polyglot
powers of their chief.</p>

<p>Prophecies of coming events, all
tending to the glorification of Punjun
Remboochee, are in the mouths of all;
and that personage is said to be preparing
himself, by the practice of
military exercises, and the accumulation
of horses, for his warlike career.</p>

<p>The Lama next in influence and
sanctity appears to be the Geesoo-Tamba,
whose residence is at Oorga
or Kooren, among the Khalka Tartars,
beyond the great Gobi desert,
on the banks of the Toola river,
which flows northward into the Siberian
Lake Baikal. This potentate,
from his special influence over the
Mongol tribes, is an object of great
jealousy at Pekin. In 1839 he
alarmed that court by announcing an
intended visit. Great stringency was
employed in reducing the number of
his retinue, but his progress through
Mongolia was a continued ovation,
the Tartars thronging on all sides to
meet and worship him. Geesoo
Tamba's visit was hurried over, and,
according to the rule in such cases, he
died on his way back.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Most of the
living Buddhas, even in the Tartar
convents, are natives of Tibet, and
the influence of the Chinese Emperor
has been exerted to arrange
that the Geesoo Tamba shall always
seek his transmigration there.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>
<p>Other sanctities of celebrity are the
Chang-kia-fo, a sort of grand almoner
to the court of Pekin, and the Saja-fo,
residing near the Himalayas, who has
a singular and special mission. He is
day and night in prayer for the perpetual
fall of snow on the peaks of
the mountains; for, according to
Tibetan tradition, behind that range
dwells a savage race, which only
bides the thawing of the snows to
pass the barrier, massacre the tribes
of Bod, and seize their country.</p>

<p>The story related by Tavernier
Grueber and Father Giorgi,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> regarding
the degrading superstition with
which the basest personal relics of
the reigning Lama were cherished by
his votaries, was utterly denied to
both Bogle and the French missionaries.
The former ascribes the origin
of the story to the Lama's practice
of distributing little balls of consecrated
flour, which the superstition of
his more ignorant votaries may have
converted into what they pleased.</p>

<p>Convents are exceeding numerous
both in Tibet and Mongolia. In the
former their number is said to amount
to 3000, some near Lhassa containing
as many as 15,000 members.</p>

<p>These convents consist usually of
groups of whitewashed cells or cottages,
clustered together on a hill-side,
interspersed with temples of
fantastic architecture. Opposite the
great entrance to a temple is a sort
of altar, above which the idols are
enshrined, usually of handsome Caucasian
features and colossal size,
seated cross-legged. Before the chief
image, (representing Maha-muni or
Sakya,) and on a level with the altar,
is a gilded seat for the Regenerate or
Grand Lama of the convent, the rest
of the apartment being occupied by
rows of carpeted benches.</p>

<p>At prayer time, a conch blown at
the temple-gate summons the members
to their devotions. After making three
prostrations to the head, they take
their places, according to precedence,
on the benches, seating themselves
cross-legged and <i>vis-à-vis</i>, as choir and
anti-choir. When a bell, rung by
the master of the ceremonies, gives
the signal, all commence muttering
in a low tone a preparatory act of
devotion, as they unrol on their knees
the rubrical form of the day. After
this short recitation is an interval of
profound silence. The bell rings
again, and then rises a psalmody of
responsive choirs, in a grave and
melodious tone. The Tibetan prayers,
broken usually into verses, and composed
in a style of rhythmic cadence,
lend themselves with marvellous
effect to concerted recitation. At
intervals of repose, fixed by the
rubrics, the instrumental band executes
a piece of music. In the Tartar
choirs this is described by Huc as
a confused and stunning jumble of
instruments, all the performers emulous
in din. Turner, however, in a
similar description of the service,
speaks more respectfully of the Tibetan
instrumental music. According to
the latter authority also, the Tibetans
possess a musical notation. Their
instruments are generally on a large
scale;&mdash;sliding trumpets from six to
ten feet long, which Moorcroft describes
as of very deep and majestic
intonation; kettle drums; cymbals,
highly mellow and sonorous; gongs,
hautboys; a large shallow drum,
mounted on a tall pedestal: these,
with the human tibia and the sea-conch,
compose their religious band.</p>

<p>From the earliest traveller to the
court of the Grand Khan, to the last
vice-regal aide-de-camp whose arduous
duties have led him up the Sutlej
to the pleasant slopes of Cheenee in
Kunawur, whence Ramsay of Dalwolsie
dealeth law to the millions of
India from under the ripening grapes,
all witnesses of the Lamaitic worship
have been struck with the extraordinary
resemblance of many features
of the ecclesiastical system and
ritual to those of the Roman Catholic
Church. Rubruquis, who travelled
in the thirteenth century,
mentions a Mongolian people called
Jugurs, (probably the Chakars of M.
Huc,) whom he brands as rank idolaters,
but at the same time admits that
it is most difficult to distinguish many
of their observances from those of the
Catholic Church. They had holy
candles, rosaries, and conventual
celibacy. The further description of
these Jugurs identifies them as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
Buddhists. "They placed their
ideas of perfection in the silent and
abstracted contemplation of the Divinity.
They sit in the temples on
two long forms, opposite to each
other, repeating mentally the words,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Om mam hactami</i>, but without uttering
a word." The missionaries of after
days are struck by the same resemblances.
Father Grueber, in
1661, states that at Lhassa there are
two kings&mdash;one civil, the other sacred.
"They regard the latter as the true
and living God, the eternal and
celestial Father. Those who approach
prostrate themselves before
him and kiss his feet, exactly as is
done to his holiness the Pope; so
showing the manifest deceits of the
devil, who has transferred the veneration
due to the sole Vicar of Christ
to the superstitious worship of barbarous
nations, as he has also, in his
innate malignity, abused the other
mysteries of the Christian faith."
Father Desideri, without directly
making such comparisons, indicates
more marvellous coincidences than
any one else; in fact, he drew
some aid from a lively imagination
when he deduced that the
people of Ladakh had some idea of
the Trinity, because they sometimes
used the singular and sometimes the
plural in speaking of the Deity, and
from the form of the sacred symbol
constantly in their mouths, which he
simplifies into <i>Om ha hum</i>! "They
adore," he goes on to say, "one <i>Urghien</i>(?),
who was born seven hundred
years ago. If you ask them if he was
God or man, they will answer sometimes
that he is both God and man, and
that he had neither father nor mother,
but was born of a flower. Nevertheless,
they have images representing a
woman with a flower in her hand,
and this, I was told, was the mother
of Urghien. They adore several
other persons, whom they regard as
saints. In their churches you see an
altar covered with an altar-cloth; on
the middle of the altar is a sort of
tabernacle, where, according to them,
Urghien resides, although at other
times they will assure you that he is
in heaven." Turner and Moorcroft,
Protestant laymen, were as much
struck by the resemblance of the
choral service to the mass as the
Roman priests, and none testify to it
more frequently than our latest travellers,
Huc and Gabet. "The
crosier, the mitre, the Dalmatica,
the cope or pluvial which the
Grand Lamas wear in travelling,
the double-choired liturgy, the
psalmody, the exorcisms, the censer
swung by five chains, and opening and
shutting at will; the benedictions
given by the Lama, in stretching his
right hand over the head of the faithful;
the rosary, the ecclesiastical
celibate, the spiritual retreats, the
worship of the saints; fasts, processions,
holy water," (and they might
have added, the tonsure, the ringing
of bells during service, the conclave
assembled in a temple to elect a
pontiff, and the appellation of <i>Eternal
Sanctuary</i> applied to Lhassa, the
Rome of their faith, by the Tartars,)
"in all these numerous particulars
do the Buddhists coincide with us."
The matter-of-fact Moorcroft describes
a Lama of Ladakh as dressed
almost like a cardinal. Allowing
for some accidental and some exaggerated
similarities, more analogy
remains than can well be explained,
without supposing that the Lamas
may have borrowed and adapted parts
of the Church ritual from the Nestorians,
who were early diffused over
Asia; or perhaps that the churches of
the latter, sinking in corruption and
ignorance, had merged in the sea of
superstition which surrounded them,
leaving only some corrupted relics of
external rites floating on the surface
to mark that a church of Christ had
once existed there.</p>

<p>As the Christian world is divided
into Papist and Protestant, and the
body of Islam into Soonnee and Sheea,
so also the Lamas have their two
great sects, the <i>Gelook-pa</i> and <i>Dok-pa</i>,
distinguished by the colour of their
caps&mdash;yellow being adopted by the
former, red by the latter.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Celibacy
is <em>binding</em> only on the Gelook-pa, but
all who aspire to superior sanctity
profess it. They all abstain from
taking animal life, and some of
especial austerity will not even take
vegetable life, deeming it unlawful to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
cut down a tree unless it be withered,
or to gather fruit unless it be ripe.
Strong drink is forbidden to all the
sects. The reform which originated
the sect of the Gelook-pa, now predominant
over Tibet and Mongolia,
and claiming the Emperor himself as
one of its adherents, was the work
of Tsongkhapa, a celebrated Tibetan
teacher of the fourteenth century.
He is traditionally stated to have
derived his doctrine from a mysterious
western stranger, endowed with
great learning and Slawkenbergian
nose. To the innovations in the
Lamaitic worship introduced by
Tsongkhapa, the missionaries ascribe
many of the more striking resemblances
to Roman ritual, and they
feel inclined to believe that the
mysterious stranger from the West
may have been a Catholic missionary,
whose teaching was imperfectly
received or apprehended. The
large nose they conceive may only
be an indication of the European
physiognomy from the Mongolian
point of view. We have a counterpart
portrait of the Mongolian from
a Caucasian pencil, in Benjamin
of Tudela, who speaks of the "Copperal
Turks" as having <em>no noses</em>,
but only two holes in the face
through which they breathe. So
also Rubruquis, when he was presented
to the wife of Scacatai, a
Tartar Khan, verily thought she had
cut and pared her nose till she had
left herself none at all!</p>

<p>Among other Romanising rites we
find something analogous to masses
for the dead. In a temple at Ladakh,
Moorcroft witnessed the consecration
of food for the use of the souls of those
condemned to hell, without which, it
was believed, they would starve. The
chief Lama consecrated barley and
water, and poured them from a silver
saucer into a brass basin, occasionally
striking two cymbals together, and
chaunting prayers, to which an inferior
Lama from time to time uttered
responses aloud, accompanied by the
rest in an under-tone. Somewhat
different appears to have been the
annual festival in honour of the dead,
or "All Souls," of which Turner gives
a striking description. As soon as it
became dark, a general illumination
was displayed on the summits of all
the buildings of the monastery; the
tops of the houses on the plain, and
of the distant villages, were also lighted,
exhibiting altogether a brilliant spectacle.
Though accustomed to esteem
illuminations the strongest expressions
of public joy, Turner now saw them
exhibited as a solemn token of melancholy
remembrance&mdash;an awful tribute
of respect to the innumerable
generations of the dead. Darkness,
silence, interrupted occasionally by
the deep slow tones of the kettle-drum,
trumpet, gong, and cymbal; at different
intervals, the tolling of bells, and
loud monotonous repetition of sentences
of prayer, sometimes heard when
the instruments were silent, all united
to produce an impression of seriousness
and awe. Remarkably similar
is the description given by the Frenchmen
of the nocturnal litanies which
they witnessed when resident in the
convent of Koonboom.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Another
impressive devotional practice is mentioned
by the last travellers, and one
which is the more pleasing, as not
being confined to the clergy. "They
have at Lhassa a touching custom,
which we were almost jealous of
meeting among unbelievers. In the
evening, as the daylight is passing
into twilight, all the Tibetans suspend
their occupation, and meet
in groups, according to sex and age,
in the public places of the town.
As soon as the parties are formed,
all sit down on the ground, and
begin to chaunt prayers in a slow
and subdued tone. The aggregation
of the sound of prayer, rising all over
the city, produces a vast and solemn
hum of harmony, which strangely
moves the spirit."</p>

<p>The Buddhistic, symbol, or mystic
form of concentrated prayer, <i>Om mani
padme hom</i>, is not only heard from
every mouth, or silently repeated on the
rosary, but is to be seen written everywhere&mdash;in
streets, public places, walls
of apartments, on the fringes of the
ceremonial scarf, on the flags that wave
from the house-tops, and from cairns on
the mountains; engraven on the rocks,
carved on monuments by the way, or
formed with stones, in gigantic spelling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
on the hill-side, so as to be legible at
considerable distances. Rich Buddhists
maintain travelling Lamas, to go
about, like Old Mortality, with hammer
and chisel, multiplying the sacred
sentences on the faces of the cliffs, and
on stones by the highway. The words
are Sanscrit, and came from India
with the Buddhist faith in the seventh
century. The Lamas say that these
sacred words include an infinity of
doctrine, which the life of man suffices
not to survey, but their infinitesimal
amount of meaning to the uninitiated
is said to be&mdash;"<em>Oh, the precious
lotus.&mdash;Amen!</em>"</p>

<p>The great difference between the
Tibetan lama-serais and the convents
of Romanised Europe appears to be,
that the members of the former,
though subjected to the same rule,
and under one superior, cannot be said
to live in common, the various gradations
of wealth and poverty being
as distinctly marked among them as
among the laity. Lamas in rags
may sometimes be seen begging of
their wealthy brethren in the same
convent. The revenue of the convent
foundation, if it has one, is distributed
at intervals in the form of a scanty
supply of meal, in rations proportioned
to rank in the hierarchy. Occasionally
donations from pilgrims also
fall to be divided. Sometimes a pilgrim
"stands" tea to the whole convent&mdash;no
small expense, when it numbers
several thousand members. Many
Lamas augment their means by practising
as physicians, fortune-tellers,
or exorcists; by various handicrafts,
or by keeping retail-shops for the benefit
of their brethren. Others are
occupied in printing or transcribing
religious books. The character is
alphabetic, being a modification of the
Nagari or Sanscrit letters introduced
by Tongmi Sambodha, one of the
first missionaries of Buddhism; but
printing is, of course, conducted on
the Chinese block system. The leaves
are loose, printed on both sides,
placed between two wooden boards,
and tied with a yellow band. The
character used in correspondence differs
greatly from that of the printed
books and literary MSS., being much
more rounded and fluent. It is, however,
perhaps, like our own writing,
only a modification of the other adapted
to a current hand.</p>

<p>The classic Tibetan literature appears
to consist in two or three great
collections, or cyclopædias, in many
volumes, the greater part translated
in remote times from ancient Sanscrit
works. From the abstracts given
in the <cite>Journal of the Asiatic Society
of Bengal</cite>, by the one European who
has mastered the subject, Alexander
Csoma de Körös,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> these books appear
to be a dreary wilderness of
puerile metaphysics and misplaced labour.</p>

<p>According to M. Huc, the Lama
physicians reckon 440 maladies affecting
the human frame, neither more
nor less. Their medical books, which
the students of the faculty have to
learn by heart, consist of a mass of
aphorisms, more or less obscure, and
a number of recipes. Most of their
medicines are vegetable simples, generally
mild and inoffensive. The
number of their "simples," however,
includes "<i>laudamy</i> and <i>calamy</i>." At
least, they have the art of preparing
mercury, and use it as a specific,
producing salivation. This result they
promote by gagging the patient with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
a stick. Their diagnosis they derive
principally from the pulse, professing
to discover the seat of disease
from its peculiar vibratory motion
rather than its frequency. They have
not the Chinese horror of bleeding,
and practise cupping by help of a
cowhorn and oral suction. Small-pox
is held in great dread; indeed, they
scarcely attempt to treat it, but endeavour
to save the uninfected by
cutting off all communication at the
risk of starving the sufferers. The
infected house or village is often razed
to the ground.</p>

<p>Some of the baser class of the Lamas
seek notoriety and lucre by juggling
and disgusting feats, professing to rip
open their stomachs, to lick red-hot
iron bars, &amp;c. &amp;c., and to perform
other such exploits. Messrs Huc and
Gabet knew a Lama who was generally
reputed able at will to fill a vessel of
water by means of a certain form of
prayer. They never could get him to
perform in their presence, however.
He said that, as they had not the
same faith, the attempt would be unsuccessful,
and perhaps dangerous.
He obliged them by reciting his charm,
which, it must be confessed, reads so
like a Dr Faustus contract, that one
cannot but suppose that the preconceived
ideas of the good missionaries
have lent it a little colouring. The
Lama was, perhaps, after all, only an
<em>electro-biologist</em>. Respectable Lamas
affect to frown on such displays, but
wink at them occasionally, for profit's
sake.</p>

<p>Lamas of an ascetic spirit, not content
with the duties of the convent,
sometimes seek the seclusion which
the desolate wilds of their country
offer so plentifully, dwelling in eyries
on the pinnacles of hills, either cut in
the rock, or formed of timber attached
to the cliff like swallows' nests. Sometimes
these eremites, like Simon of the
pillar, renounce all intercourse with
the world&mdash;depending for their sustenance
on the gifts of the devout dropt
into a sack, which is let down from
the inaccessible cell by a long cord.</p>

<p>Convents of nuns also exist, both
in Tibet Proper and in Ladakh; they
do not, however, appear to have been
visited by any traveller, and the
French fathers make no mention of
them.</p>

<p>The inhumation of the dead is entirely
unpractised in Tibet. The body
of the sovereign Lama alone is preserved
entire, and deposited in a
shrine which is ever after looked on as
sacred, and visited with religious awe.
The bodies of inferior Lamas are burnt,
and their ashes carefully preserved, to
be enclosed in small metallic images,
which have places assigned them in
cabinets ranged in the sacred buildings.
Sometimes, but not often, bodies
are committed to the waters of lakes
or rivers; but the common disposal of
the dead is by making them over&mdash;</p>

<p>
&mdash;&mdash;κυνεσσιν<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">οιωνοισι τε πασι&mdash;</span><br />
</p>

<p class="noind">either in carrying the corpses to the
tops of lofty eminences, where the
divided limbs are left for a prey, or, in
depositing them in regular golgothas
assigned for the purpose. These are
enclosed yards, having openings left
in the foot of the walls for the
admission of dogs and wolves. But
the most popular form of this practice
is when the body is cut in pieces
at once, and given to the dogs to
eat. For the interment, or rather the
<em>incanition</em>, of persons of distinction,
in certain convents sacred dogs are
maintained, which are set apart to
this office. Strabo, Cicero, and Justin
mention such customs as current
among the nations of Central Asia.
They prevail not only in Tibet, but
among the nomad tribes of Mongolia,
and appear to have no connection
with the existing religion of these
races. The practice of the Parsees is
well known to be of a similar character.
The most sanctified Lamas are
privileged to eat and drink out of the
skulls of bodies which have been thus
devoured by beasts. Rosaries also
are made from these skulls, and the
larger bones are often converted into
trumpets.</p>

<p>The profane vulgar, though uninstructed
in the tedious liturgic lore
which the Lamas acquire, not without
plentiful corporal chastisement in the
days of their pupilage, are enabled to
achieve a meritorious amount of devotion
by the aid of certain whirligigs,
or prayer-mills&mdash;cylinders of wood or
pasteboard, inscribed with the words
of prayer, and rotating on a spindle.
These <i>chu-kor</i>, or turn-prayers, which
at one time, as a pet subject of allusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
with Thomas Carlyle, almost
rivalled Thurtell's gig, are either portable
or stationary, generally turned
by hand, but often by water-power;
and in the Tartar huts they are suspended
over the fireplace, so as to rotate
like smoke-jacks, in behalf of the
peace and prosperity of the family.</p>

<p>Various penances are performed by
the pilgrims who visit the sacred
places. Some make the circuit of the
convent buildings laden with enormous
piles of sacred books. The task
achieved, they are reckoned to have
recited all the prayers which form
their load. Others perform the same
circuit in measuring their length upon
the ground at each step. This is a
task often undertaken by great numbers
following each other in single
file; and if the convent be extensive,
the day, from dawn till dusk, is occupied
in the task. Some penitents, instead
of making the tour of a single
convent, perform long journeys in this
fashion. The practice is known in
India; and we remember to have heard
of a Hindoo worthy, who, some sixty
or seventy years ago, undertook to
measure his way from Hurdwar to
Calcutta, prophesying the while that,
when he should have achieved his
dusty task, the days of the Feringees'
power would be numbered. Great
was the twisting of mustaches and
the furbishing of tulwars among the
disaffected; but, alas! in passing
Cawnpoor the unlucky prophet made
his last prostration; he was laid hold
of by the general, and hanged.</p>

<p>We had purposed to conclude this
paper with a sketch of the journeys of
previous travellers in Tibet, and some
details of the last very interesting one
from which we have derived many
particulars, but we have now room for
only very brief indications.</p>

<p>The name of Tibet appears to have
first become known to Europe in the
itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela, a
Jewish Rabbi, who travelled to the far
East about the year 1160. He mentions
that country as producing musk,
but errs widely in placing it only four
days' journey from Samarkand.</p>

<p>In the succeeding century, when the
flood of Mongolian conquest, under
Jenghiz and his successors, dissolved
all political barriers, and brought the
civilisations of the East and West for
the first time in contact, a greater
amount of intercourse ensued between
Europe and interior Asia than has
ever occurred before or since. At the
noise of the coming Tartars, Europe
stood amazed, and even the bewildered
Danes were deterred for one
season from starting for their herring
fishery on our northern shores, lest
they should fall into the hands of
this mysterious foe. Pouring over
Hungary and Poland to the frontiers
of Silesia, they defeated and cut in
pieces the duke of that country with
his army, and it seemed as if the
knell of Christendom had sounded,
when providentially the death of the
great Khan summoned the host back
into Tartary; and the invasion of
Western Europe, though often threatened,
was never resumed. Embassies
from the Roman Pontiff and European
princes, at first of intercession and
supplication, afterwards on more equal
terms, when the dread of the Khan
had passed away, were despatched
and reciprocated. Monks of Flanders,
France, and Italy, visited the
seat of the Grand Khan, and a Latin
archiepiscopate was established in
Pekin. French artists worked in gold
and silver for the court of Kara-Korum,
and a banished Englishman was
the first ambassador from the Tartars
to the king of Hungary; whilst Mongols
of distinction found their way to
Rome, to Barcelona, to Paris, to London,
to Northampton. "The arts,
the faith, and the language of the nations
of Asia became a subject of curiosity
and study, and it was even
proposed to establish a Tartar chair in
the university of Paris."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>During this extraordinary intercourse,
which continued for a century
and a half, the lines of travel eastward
lay generally to the north of
Tibet, and hints of its existence are
rare and slight. Marco Polo, indeed,
who travelled in the last quarter of the
thirteenth century, devotes two of his
Herodotean chapters to "the Province
of Thibet." A few particulars,
such as the existence of powerful dogs,
of the musk animal, and the current
use of salt in barter, are recognisable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
but the country referred to is apparently
the wild and rugged region of
the Si-fan, towards the east and
north-east of Tibet.</p>

<p>Oderic of Portenau, a travelling
friar, who died in 1331, mentions
Tibet, and is the first who speaks of
the Grand Lama as the <em>pope of the
idolaters</em>.</p>

<p>The Romish missionaries of later
times made repeated attempts to establish
themselves in the Trans-Himalayan
regions. The first who appears
to have succeeded in penetrating
them was Antonio d'Andrada, a
Portuguese Jesuit, with three companions
of his order. In 1624 they
ascended the Ganges by Hurdwar and
Srinuggur to Budrinath, a celebrated
place of Hindoo pilgrimage on the
eastern branch of the sacred river.
Apprehending hindrances to their advance,
they made a desperate attempt
to cross the pass into Tibet, (probably
the Niti, or one of those nearer
Lake Manusaráwur,) whilst it was
still deep in snow, and without a guide.
They succeeded, after frightful suffering,
in surmounting the pass, but,
finding the country at their feet a
trackless sheet of snow, were compelled
to return. Waiting for the usual
convoy after the melting of the winter
snow, they again effected the passage,
and proceeded to what they call Rudac,
the capital of Tibet. There is a fort
so called (Radokh or Rohtuk) beyond
the Indus, near the head of the Pangkung
Lake; but Ladakh or Le is
more likely to have been the place intended.</p>

<p>Though it seems scarcely credible
that four strangers should have found
their way twice across the Himalayan
passes unguided, and before the regular
season of transit, and yet survive
to tell the tale, it must be said that
Andrada's description of their Himalayan
travels, in other respects, bears
every mark of truth. The precipitous
paths along the Ganges, the files
of pilgrims shouting as they trudged
to Budrinath, the demon-like Jogees
whom they encountered, the straight
and lofty pines and cypresses, the
large rose-bushes, and forests of flowering
trees, (rhododendron,) the rope
bridges, the sufferings in the snow and
from the attenuated air, are all plainly
drawn from actual experience.</p>

<p>The next visitors to Tibet, and the
first Europeans, so far as we know,
who reached Lhassa, were the Fathers
Albert Dorville and J. Grueber of the
Chinese mission. They started from
Pekin in June 1661, and travelled
through China to Sining-fu, on the
north-west frontier. From this place
their route probably coincided with
that of Huc and Gabet, who reached
the same place from Eastern Mongolia.
Their journey thence to
Lhassa, Grueber describes as extending
for three months through the
deserts of Kalmuk Tartary, alternately
sandy and mountainous. After
some stay at Lhassa, they proceeded
over the mountain range of "Langur,
the highest existing, so that on its
summit travellers can scarcely breathe
on account of the subtlety of the air;
nor can it be passed in summer, on
account of the virulent exhalations of
certain herbs, without manifest danger
to life." Descending into the
kingdom of <i>Necbal</i>, (Nepaul,) they
passed some time at the capital, <i>Cudmendou</i>
(Katmandoo). Quitting Nepaul,
they entered the kingdom of
<i>Maranga</i> (the Morung, or forest
tract below the hills.) Proceeding
by <i>Mutgari</i> (Mooteeharee probably, in
Tirhoot) to <i>Battana</i> (Patna) on the
Ganges, and thence to Benares, they
reached Agra after 214 days' travelling
from Pekin, exclusive of stoppages.
Dorville died of fatigue shortly
after the accomplishment of this heroic
journey. The narrative, as abstracted
in Kircher's <cite>China Illustrata</cite>, is
adorned with some rather good cuts,
most of which appear to have been
derived from genuine sketches.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth volume of <cite>Lettres
Edifiantes</cite> is an epistle dated from
Lhassa, 10th April 1716, by Father
Hipolito Desideri, a Jesuit. It relates
his journey from Goa to Delhi,
where he was joined by a brother
missionary; thence by Lahore over
the Pir Punjál to Kashmeer, and, after
a residence of six months there, across
the passes of the Himalayas, to Le or
Ladakh, which he describes as the
royal fortress of the kingdom of Great
Tibet, or <i>Buton</i>. Whilst making
arrangements to settle at Ladakh,
and commencing the study of the
language, the fathers heard for the
first time of a <em>third</em> Tibet, (viz. the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
Lhassa country, in addition to Little
Tibet or Balti, and Great Tibet, or
Ladakh,) and thought it necessary
to proceed to explore it. The journey
occupied them from August 1715 to
March 1716. Desideri and his comrade
are the only Europeans who
have ever travelled from Ladakh to
Lhassa; but, unfortunately, they give
no particulars of their route except
these dates, and even the great delay
which they indicate is not accounted
for.</p>

<p>Previous to this, a Capuchin mission
had visited Lhassa <i>via</i> Nepaul in
1707, and a few years later, a dozen
brethren of that order were established
there under Father Horace
della Penna. They sent home flourishing
accounts of their success; but
their additions to our knowledge of
the country were very meagre. About
1754 this mission appears to have
been expelled, and found refuge
for a time in Nepaul. Some fifty
volumes, the relics of the mission
library, were, in 1847, recovered
from Lhassa by Mr Hodgson, through
the courtesy of the Grand Lama himself,
and were transmitted to Europe
to be presented to Pio Nono, whose
reputation was then fresh and fragrant.
Some itineraries and other
curious particulars, derived from the
correspondence of the Lhassa mission,
are buried, among a mass of crude
learning and rubbish, in a quarto
published at Rome in 1762, under
the name of <cite>Alphabetum Tibetanum</cite>,
by Antonio Giorgi, an Augustin friar.</p>

<p>Of the missions of Bogle and Turner
we have already spoken. In 1811,
a Mr Manning succeeded in reaching
Lhassa by their route, but was arrested
and sent back by the Chinese.
He died soon after without publishing
any particulars of his journey. The
sacred lakes of Ngari have been visited
by Moorcroft, Captains Henry and
Richard Strachey, and one or two
more. Ladakh and the adjoining districts
have been explored by the two
former travellers, the Cunninghams,
and others. But within this century,
save Manning, no European, till
Huc and Gabet, had penetrated to
Tibet Proper. The enthusiastic Hungarian
scholar, who would have gone
with advantages possessed by none
else, was cut off just as he deemed this
object of his cherished hopes attainable.</p>

<p>A few words remain to be said
more particularly of the work which
suggested this paper. These need be
few, because a translation of the
whole work has been announced since
we commenced writing.</p>

<p>The book which the missionaries
have produced is not altogether satisfactory.
It too well justifies its title
of <cite>Souvenirs</cite> by the lamentable paucity
of dates, of which there are not half-a-dozen
in the whole narrative of
their two years' pilgrimage. Even
the period of their starting is not
stated at the time, and is only to be
distinctly gathered from some retrospective
calculations. Their geographical
starting-point, too, is as obscure as
the chronological one. Our maps help us
little in following the details of their
travels; and that which is inserted
in their book is of as little aid as
any other, being, in fact, dated five
years previous to their journey.
Nor, we fear, will they be found
to have added much to the materials
of future geographers; their work
contains no indication of a single
bearing or altitude, nor indeed had
they the necessary instruments. The
possession, indeed, of MS. maps
would have endangered their lives in
any collision with Chinese authority,
such as actually befel them at Lhassa;
but many valuable data might have
been recorded without graphical embodiment.
The worthy men, however,
make no pretensions to science; they
record of the Ko-ko-noor or Blue Lake
on the north-east frontier of Tibet,
that it has a flux and reflux of tide,
without any further particulars of so
marvellous a phenomenon, though
they were some time encamped on its
banks: they ascribe unquestioningly
their sufferings, in passing certain lofty
mountains, to poisonous exhalations
from the soil; and they quit Tibet
without a word as to the vexed question
regarding the course of the Sanpoo.
But they have given us a most
readable and interesting personal narrative
of a life of continued hardships,
and of frequent suffering and danger
in remote regions, the routes through
which were partly never before recorded
in detail, and partly never
before trodden by any European.</p>

<p>Ladies of Britain, deftly embroidering
in carpeted saloon, gracefully
bending over easel or harp, pressing,
with nimble finger, your piano's ivory,
or joyously tripping in Cellarian
circles, suspend, for a moment, your
silken pursuits, and look forth into the
desert at a sister's sufferings! May you
never, from stern experience, learn
fully to appreciate them. But, should
fate have otherwise decreed, may you
equal her in fortitude and courage.
Meanwhile, transport yourselves, in
imagination's car, to Canada's backwoods,
and behold one, gently nurtured
as yourselves, cheerfully condescending
to rudest toils, unrepiningly
enduring hardships you never dreamed
of. Not to such hardships was she
born, nor educated for them. The
comforts of an English home, the
endearments of sisterly affection, the
refinement of literary tastes, but ill
prepared the emigrant's wife to work,
in the rugged and inclement wilderness,
harder than the meanest of the
domestics, whom, in her own country,
she was used to command. But
where are the obstacles and difficulties
that shall not be overcome by a
strong will, a warm heart, a trusting
and cheerful spirit?&mdash;precious qualities,
strikingly combined by the lady
of whose countless trials and troubles
we have here an affecting and remarkable
record.</p>

<p>The Far West of Canada is so remote
a residence, and there is so much
oblivion in a lapse of twenty years,
that it may be necessary to mention
who the authoress is who now appeals
(successfully, or we are much
mistaken) to the favour of her countrymen,
and more especially of her
countrywomen. Of a family well
known in literature, Mrs Moodie is a
sister of Miss Agnes Strickland, the
popular and accomplished historical
biographer. In 1831, Miss Susanna
Strickland published a volume of
poems. Had she remained in England,
she in time, perhaps, might have
rivalled her sister's fame as one of
the most distinguished female writers
of the day. But it was otherwise
ordained. In 1832 she sailed, as
Mrs Moodie, an emigrant to Canada.
Under most unfavourable circumstances,
she still from time to time
took up the pen. The anxieties and
accidents of her forest life, her regrets
for the country she loved so well, and
had left perhaps for ever, and, subsequently,
the rebellion in Canada,
suggested many charming songs and
poems, some of which are still
extremely popular in our North
American colony. Years passed
amidst hardships and sufferings. At
last a brighter day dawned, and it is
from a tranquil and happy home, as
we gladly understand, that the settler's
brave wife has transmitted this
narrative of seven years' exertion and
adventure.</p>

<p>Inevitable hardships, some ill luck,
some little want of judgment and deliberation,
make up the history of
Captain and Mrs Moodie's early days
in Canada. "I give you just three
years to spend your money and ruin
yourself," said an old Yankee hag
with whom the Captain was concluding
the purchase of a wretched log-hut.
It scarcely took so long. Borrowing
our colours from Mrs Moodie's
pages, we may broadly sketch the
discomforts of the emigrant's first few
months in Canada. These were passed
near the village of C&mdash;&mdash;, on the
north shore of Lake Ontario. A farm
of one hundred and fifty acres, about
fifty of which were cleared, was purchased
by Captain Moodie, for £300,
of a certain Q&mdash;&mdash;, a landjobber.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Q&mdash;&mdash;," says the Captain, who has
contributed two or three chapters to his
wife's book, "held a mortgage for £150,
on a farm belonging to a certain Yankee
settler, named Joe H&mdash;&mdash;, as security for
a debt incurred for goods at his store.
The idea instantly struck him that he
would compel Joe H&mdash;&mdash; to sell him his
farm, by threatening to foreclose the
mortgage. I drove out with Mr Q&mdash;&mdash;
next day to see the farm in question. It
was situated in a pretty retired valley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
surrounded by hills, about eight miles
from C&mdash;&mdash;, and about a mile from the
great road leading to Toronto. There
was an extensive orchard upon the farm,
and two log-houses, and a large frame-barn.
A considerable portion of the
cleared land was light and sandy; and
the uncleared part of the farm, situated
on the flat rocky summit of a high hill,
was reserved for 'a sugar bush,' and for
supplying fuel."</p></blockquote>

<p>Pleased with the place, Captain
Moodie bought it, and, having done
so, had leisure to repent his bargain.
Of the land he got possession in the
month of September; but it was not
till the following summer that the
occupants of the house could be prevailed
upon to depart. Until then
the new comers dwelt in the wretched
hut already mentioned. Even to
this hovel Mrs Moodie's English
habits of order and neatness imparted
something like comfort; but a still
greater evil, beyond her power to
remedy, was connected with her residence.
Her nearest neighbours were
disreputable Yankee settlers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"These people regarded British settlers
with an intense feeling of dislike, and
found a pleasure in annoying and insulting
them when any occasion offered. They
did not understand us, nor did we them,
and they generally mistook the reserve
which is common with the British towards
strangers, for pride and superciliousness.</p>

<p>"'You Britishers are too <em>superstitious</em>,'
one of them told me on a particular occasion.</p>

<p>"It was some time before I found out
what he meant by the term '<em>superstitious</em>,'
and that it was generally used by them
for 'supercilious.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>All that poor Mrs Moodie endured
from her reprobate neighbours, could
not be told in detail within the compass
of a much larger work than hers.
But we may glean a tolerable idea of
her constant vexations and annoyance
from her first volume, which contains
sketches, at once painful and humorous,
of the persecutions to which she
was subjected. Impudent intrusion
and unscrupulous borrowings were of
daily occurrence, varied occasionally
by some gross act of unneighbourliness
and aggression. Although evidently
a person of abundant energy
and spirit, Mrs Moodie, partly through
terror of these semi-savages, and partly
from a wish to conciliate and make
friends, long submitted to insolence
and extortion. The wives and daughters
of the Yankee settlers&mdash;some of
whom had "squatted," without leave
or license, on ground to which they
had no right, made a regular property
of her. Every article of domestic
use, kettles and pans, eatables,
drinkables, and wearables, did these
insatiable wretches borrow&mdash;and never
return. They would walk into her
house and carry off the very things
she at the moment needed, or come
in her absence and take her gown
from the peg, or the pot from the fire.
The three families from which she had
most to endure were those of a red-headed
American squatter, who had
fled his own country for some crime;
of "Uncle Joe," the former proprietor
of her farm, and still the occupant of
her house; and of "Old Satan," a disgusting
and brutal Yankee, who had
had one eye gouged out in a fight, and
whose face was horribly disfigured by
the scars of wounds inflicted by his
adversary's teeth. A pertinacious
tormentor, too, was old Betty Fye,
who lived in the log shanty across the
creek. Having made Mrs Moodie's
acquaintance, under pretence of selling
her a "rooster," she became a constant
and most unwelcome visitor,
borrowing everything she could think
of, returning nothing, and interlarding
her discourse with oaths, which
greatly shocked the good-tempered
English lady.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Everybody swears in this country,'
quoth Betty Fye. 'My boys (she was a
widow with twelve sons) all swear like
Sam Hill; and I used to swear mighty
big oaths, till about a month ago, when the
Methody parson told me that if I did not
leave it off I should go to a tarnation bad
place; so I dropped some of the worst of
them.'</p>

<p>"'You would do well to drop the rest;
women never swear in my country.'</p>

<p>"'Well, you don't say! I always
hear'd they were very ignorant. Will
you lend me the tea?'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Tea to-day&mdash;it was something else
to-morrow. Mrs Moodie tried every
means of affronting her, but long
without success. The most natural
and effectual plan would have been to
refuse all her demands; but to this
Mrs Moodie, perhaps from unwillingness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
to disoblige, was tardy in having
recourse. At last she got rid of her
by quoting Scripture.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The last time I was honoured with a
visit from Betty Fye, she meant to favour
me with a very large order upon my
goods and chattels.</p>

<p>"'Well, Mrs Fye, what do you want
to-day?'</p>

<p>"'So many things, that I scarce know
where to begin. Ah, what a thing it is to
be poor! First, I want you to lend me
ten pounds of flour to make some
Johnie cakes.'</p>

<p>"'I thought they were made of Indian
meal?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, yes, when you've got the meal.
I'm out of it, and this is a new fixing of
my own invention. Lend me the flour,
woman, and I'll bring you one of the
cakes to taste.'</p>

<p>"This was said very coaxingly.</p>

<p>"'Oh, pray don't trouble yourself.
What next?' I was anxious to see how
far her impudence would go, and determined
to affront her, if possible.</p>

<p>"'I want you to lend me a gown and
a pair of stockings. I have to go to
Oswego, to see my husband's sister, and
I'd like to look decent.'</p>

<p>"'Mrs Fye, I never lend my clothes to
any one. If I lent them to you, I should
never wear them again.'</p>

<p>"'So much the better for me,' (with a
knowing grin.) 'I guess if you won't
lend me the gown, you will let me have
some black slack to quilt a stuff petticoat,
a quarter of a pound of tea and
some sugar; and I will bring them back
as soon as I can.'</p>

<p>"'I wonder when that will be. You
owe me so many things that it will cost
you more than you imagine to repay me.'</p>

<p>"'Since you're not going to mention
what's past, I can't owe you much. But
I will let you off the tea and the sugar,
if you will lend me a five-dollar bill.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>This was too much for even Mrs
Moodie's patience. She read the incorrigible
Betty a sharp lecture upon
her system of robbing under colour of
borrowing, and concluded by saying
she well knew that all the things she
had <em>lent</em> her would be a debt owing
to the day of judgment.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'S'pose they are,' quoth Betty, not
in the least abashed at my lecture on
honesty, 'you know what the Scripture
saith, "It is more blessed to give than to
receive."'</p>

<p>"'Ay, there is an answer to that in
the same book, which doubtless you may
have heard,' said I, disgusted with her
hypocrisy, 'The wicked borroweth, and
payeth not again.'</p>

<p>"Never shall I forget the furious passion
into which this too apt quotation
threw my unprincipled applicant. She lifted
up her voice and cursed me, using some
of the big oaths temporarily discarded for
<em>conscience'</em> sake. And so she left me,
and I never looked upon her face again."</p></blockquote>

<p>Uncle Joe was another pleasant
neighbour, and brought up his children
to resemble himself. Mrs Joe
would occasionally stroll over to visit
Mrs Moodie, and exult over the unaccustomed
toils to which the young
English wife and mother submitted
with a cheerfulness that did her infinite
honour. It was a rough and hard
life, even for men, in that Canadian
loghouse; much worse, then, for a delicate
woman, and worst of all for one
who arrived there with an infant, and
whose family rapidly augmented.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"For a week I was alone," writes Mrs
Moodie, in the early days of her exile,
"my good Scotch girl having left me
to visit her father. Some small baby-articles
were needed to be washed, and
after making a great preparation, I determined
to try my unskilled hand upon
the operation. The fact is, I knew nothing
about the task I had imposed upon
myself, and in a few minutes rubbed the
skin off my wrists, without getting the
clothes clean. The door was open, as it
generally was, even during the coldest
winter days, in order to let in more light
and let out the smoke, which otherwise
would have enveloped us like a cloud. I
was so busy that I did not perceive that
I was watched by the cold, heavy, dark
eyes of Mrs Joe, who, with a sneering
laugh, exclaimed, 'Well, thank God!
I am glad to see you brought to work
at last.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Further, the amiable Mrs Joe declared
her intense hatred of all Britishers,
and her hearty wish that her
unoffending neighbour might be
brought down upon her knees to
scrub the floor. Mrs Moodie had
sense and dignity enough merely to
smile at her vulgar malignity. The
impudence of these people knew no
bounds. The same evening, Mrs Joe
sent over two of her offspring to
borrow something she needed of the
woman she had spitefully abused in
the morning.</p>

<p>During Mrs Moodie's abode near
C&mdash;&mdash;, Old Satan got married for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
fourth time. This was the occasion
of a charivari, a custom dating from
the French occupation of Canada, and
still kept up there. Mrs Moodie has
an amusingly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïf</i> chapter on this
subject, concerning which she has collected
some curious anecdotes. It is
hardly necessary to explain that a mismatch&mdash;of
a young and an old person&mdash;is
the usual pretext for a charivari.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The idle young fellows of the neighbourhood
disguise themselves, blackening
their faces, putting their clothes on hind
part before, and wearing horrible masks,
with grotesque caps on their heads,
adorned with cocks' feathers, and bells.
They then form in a regular body, and
proceed to the bridegroom's house, to the
sound of tin kettles, horns, drums, &amp;c.
Thus equipped, they surround the house,
just at the hour when the happy couple
are supposed to be about to retire to rest,
beating upon the door with clubs and
staves, and demanding of the bridegroom
admittance to drink the bride's health, or
in lieu thereof, a certain sum of money to
treat the band at the nearest tavern."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs Moodie expresses all a woman's
indignation at what she styles "a
lawless infringement upon the natural
rights of man." The charivari is
usually bought off&mdash;she mentions an
instance when thirty pounds were disbursed
by an antiquated swain who
had wedded a handsome widow&mdash;but
sometimes the victim resists, and
the consequences are serious. Shortly
before old Satan's bridal, a tragical
affair had taken place at one of these
saturnalia.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The bridegroom was a man in middle
life, a desperately resolute and passionate
man, and he swore that if such riff-raff
dared to interfere with him, he would
shoot at them with as little compunction
as if they were so many crows. His
threats only increased the mischievous
determination of the mob to torment
him; and when he refused to admit their
deputation, or even to give them a portion
of the wedding cheer, they determined to
frighten him into compliance by firing
several guns, loaded with peas, at his
door. Their salute was returned from
the chamber-window, by the discharge
of a double-barrelled gun, loaded with
buck-shot. The crowd gave back with a
tremendous yell. Their leader was shot
through the heart, and two of the foremost
in the scuffle dangerously wounded.
They vowed they would set fire to the
house, but the bridegroom boldly stepped
to the window and told them to try it,
and before they could light a torch he
would fire among them again, for his gun
was reloaded, and he would discharge it
at them as long as one of them dared to
remain on his premises. They cleared
off."</p></blockquote>

<p>In point of amusement there is
little difference between the first and
the second volumes of Mrs Moodie's
book&mdash;which, however, is not intended
merely to amuse, but also as "a
work of practical experience," written
for the benefit of, and conveying useful
hints to, persons contemplating
emigration to Canada. The first
volume is the gayest of the two;
there is a vein of great humour in
Mrs Moodie's descriptions and
sketches of her neighbours, and of
her wild Irish servant, John Monaghan,
who gave Uncle Joe an awful
thrashing for purloining the captain's
hay; and of Mrs D., the Yankee lady,
who considered her English neighbours
shocking proud because they did not
eat with their "helps," but was of
opinion that all negroes were children
of the devil, for that "God never
condescended to make a nigger."
But it is in the second volume that
the interest is strongest, and at times
becomes intense. Disgusted with
their neighbours, Captain and Mrs
Moodie left their farm at C&mdash;&mdash;, and
removed to the township of Douro,
forty miles off, in the backwoods,
where they had friends and relatives
settled, and where the society&mdash;consisting
chiefly of English, Irish, and
Scotch gentlemen, recently come from
Europe, and many of them half-pay
officers&mdash;was more congenial to their
tastes and habits. Unfortunately,
about this time Captain Moodie sold
his commission, in consequence of an
intimation in the newspapers that
half-pay officers must either do so or
join a regiment. This was not enforced
in the case of officers settled in
the colonies, and the captain greatly
repented his haste; the more so, as
he was induced to invest the proceeds
of his sale in shares in a steamboat
on Lake Ontario. Q&mdash;&mdash;, the landjobber,
appears to have led him into
this investment. He received no
interest on his shares, and when,
some years afterwards, the boat was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
sold, he got back only a fourth of his
capital. The mistake he made in
parting with his half-pay was the
cause of great privations and anxiety.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was a bright frosty morning," says
Mrs Moodie, "when I bade adieu to the
farm, the birthplace of my little Agnes,
who, nestled beneath my cloak, was sweetly
sleeping on my knee, unconscious of the
long journey before us into the wilderness....
It was not without regret
that I left Melsetter, for so my husband
had called the place, after his father's
estate in Orkney. It was a beautiful,
picturesque spot; and, in spite of the evil
neighbourhood, I had learned to love it;
indeed, it was much against my wish that
it was sold. I had a great dislike to removing,
which involves a necessary loss,
and is apt to give to the emigrant roving
and unsettled habits. But all regrets
were now useless; and, happily unconscious
of the life of toll and anxiety that
awaited us in those dreadful woods, I
tried my best to be cheerful, and to regard
the future with a hopeful eye."</p></blockquote>

<p>Most nobly, when the toil and
anxiety came, did this high-hearted
woman bear up against them. Severer
hardships and trials were perhaps
never endured, for so long a period,
by one of her delicate sex. At first,
affairs looked promising in the forest.
A timely legacy supplied means to
purchase and clear land and to build
a house; a considerable sum still
remained in hand, and a good income
from the steamboat stock was looked
upon as certain. The first spring in
the forest was spent in comparative
ease and idleness.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Those were the halcyon days of the
bush. My husband had purchased a very
light cedar canoe, to which he attached
a keel and a sail; and most of our leisure
hours, directly the snows melted, were
spent upon the water. These fishing
and shooting excursions were delightful....
We felt as if we were the first
discoverers of every beautiful flower and
stately tree that attracted our attention,
and we gave names to fantastic rocks
and fairy isles, and raised imaginary
houses on every picturesque spot which
we floated past during our aquatic excursions.
I learned the use of the paddle,
and became quite a proficient in the
gentle craft."</p></blockquote>

<p>They received visits from the Indians,
a number of whom (of the
Chippewa tribe) frequented a dry
cedar-swamp hard by, fishing, shooting,
and making maple-sugar, baskets,
and canoes. They were friendly
and communicative, grateful for the
slightest kindness, never intrusive or
offensively familiar; in short, they
were born gentlemen, and in every
respect a perfect contrast and immeasurably
superior to the Yankee squatters
at C&mdash;&mdash;. Mrs Moodie devotes
the greater part of a most interesting
chapter to stories and traits of her
red friends. No attention, however
small, was lost upon these warm-hearted
people. One cold night, late
in autumn, six squaws asked shelter
of Mrs Moodie. It was rather a
large party to lodge, but forest hospitality
is not stinted. There was
"Joe Muskrat's squaw" and "Betty
Cow," and an old white-haired woman,
whose scarlet embroidered leggings
showed her to be a chief's wife.
After they had all well supped, mattresses
and blankets were spread on
the parlour floor for their use, and Mrs
Moodie considerately told her servant
to give the aged squaw the best bed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The old Indian glanced at me with
her keen, bright eye; but I had no idea
that she comprehended what I said.
Some weeks after this, as I was sweeping
my parlour floor, a slight tap drew me to
the door. On opening it I perceived the
old squaw, who immediately slipped into
my hand a set of beautifully embroidered
bark trays, fitting one within the other,
and exhibiting the very best sample of
the porcupine-quill work. While I stood
wondering what this might mean, the
good old creature fell upon my neck, and
kissing me, exclaimed, 'You remember
old squaw&mdash;make her comfortable! Old
squaw no forget you. Keep them for her
sake,' and before I could detain her she
ran down the hill with a swiftness which
seemed to bid defiance to years. I never
saw this interesting Indian again, and I
concluded that she died during the winter,
for she must have been of a great age."</p></blockquote>

<p>When fortune frowned on <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nono-cosiqui</i>,
"the humming-bird," (the
name given to Mrs Moodie by the
Indians, in allusion to the pleasure
she took in painting birds,) when her
purse and pantry were alike empty,
and, in Indian phrase, "her hearthstone
was growing cold," many an
acceptable supply of much-needed
food was brought to her by her red
friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Their delicacy in conferring these
favours was not the least admirable part
of their conduct. John Nogan, who was
much attached to us, would bring a fine
bunch of ducks, and drop them at my
feet, 'for the papoose [child,]' or leave a
large muskinonge on the sill of the door,
or place a quarter of venison just within
it, and slip away without saying a word,
thinking that a present from a poor
Indian might hurt our feelings, and he
would spare us the mortification of returning
thanks."</p></blockquote>

<p>The coolness and courage of these
Indians are remarkable. Mrs Moodie
tells a story of a squaw who was left
by her husband in charge of some
dead game, and who, whilst sitting
carelessly upon a log, with his hunting-knife
in her hand, heard a cracking
amongst the branches, and, turning
round, saw a bear within a few paces
of her.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was too late to retreat; and seeing
that the animal was very hungry, and
determined to come to close quarters,
she rose, and placed her back against a
small tree, holding her knife close to her
breast, and in a straight line with the
bear. The shaggy monster came on. She
remained motionless, her eyes steadily
fixed upon her enemy, and as his huge
arms closed around her, she slowly drove
the knife into his heart. The bear
uttered a hideous cry, and sank dead at
her feet. When the Indian returned, he
found the courageous woman taking the
skin from the carcass of the formidable
brute."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs Moodie was not likely to
emulate such feats as this. She had
a horror of wild beasts, and was
afraid even of cattle. Her dread of
lions, tigers, and other unamiable
carnivora, was the reason of her finding
herself in Canada. Her husband
had a property in South Africa,
where he had passed many years, and
whither the fine climate and scenery
made him desirous to return. But
his wife would not hear of it, and,
when he tried to remove her exaggerated
terrors, referred him triumphantly
to the dangerous encounters
and hairbreadth escapes recorded in
a book of his own, called <cite>Ten Years
in South Africa</cite>. A European woman's
fear of tigers and rattle-snakes
is natural enough, and let none impute
want of courage to Mrs Moodie.
The hero of a hundred fights might
feel nervous, if perched on the top-gallant-yards
of a frigate, whose captain
might prefer boarding a French
three-decker to riding at a bull-fence.
Mrs Moodie's courage was not of the
bear-fighting sort, but of a higher
kind&mdash;moral, rather than physical.
We read with admiration and deep
sympathy of her presence of mind
and intrepidity upon many trying
occasions&mdash;when her house, for instance,
was blazing over her head,
and she alone was there to rescue
her four children and such portions
of her worldly possessions as her
strength enabled her to carry out of
the cedar-log dwelling, whose roof
"was burning like a brush heap, and,
unconsciously, she and her eldest
daughter were working under a shelf
upon which was deposited several
pounds of gunpowder, procured for
blasting a well. The gunpowder was
in a stone-jar, secured by a paper
stopper; the shelf upon which it stood
was on fire." As to her fortitude
under severe suffering&mdash;from bitter
cold and other causes&mdash;and the perseverance
with which she toiled, even at
farm-labour, they are beyond praise.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the year 1835, my husband and
I," she says, "had worked hard in the
field; it was the first time I had ever
tried my hand at field-labour, but our
ready money was exhausted, and the
steamboat stock had not paid us one
farthing; we could not hire, and there
was no help for it. I had a hard struggle
with my pride before I would consent to
render the least assistance on the farm,
but reflection convinced me that I was
wrong&mdash;that Providence had placed me
in a situation where I was called upon to
work&mdash;that it was not only my duty to
obey that call, but to exert myself to the
utmost to assist my husband, and help to
maintain my family."</p></blockquote>

<p>Most affecting is the account that
follows, of hopes disappointed and
hardships endured, in the years 1836
and 1837. To pay off debts&mdash;incurred
chiefly for clearing land, and
in confident expectation of deriving an
income from the steamboat&mdash;Captain
and Mrs Moodie resorted to a pinching
economy. Milk, bread, and
potatoes, were for months their only
fare. Tea and sugar were luxuries
not to be thought of. "I missed
the tea very much," says the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
English lady, who, on an anchorite's
fare, performed a day-labourer's
task, hoeing potatoes, and cheerfully
sharing with her husband the rude
toils of the field. "We rang the
changes on peppermint and sage,
taking the one herb at our breakfast,
the other at our tea, until I found an
excellent substitute for both in the
root of the dandelion." This root,
roasted crisp, and ground, proved a
very good imitation of coffee. Squirrel&mdash;stewed,
roast, and in pies&mdash;was a
standard dish at the dinner-table in
the bush. In a trap set near the
barn, often ten or twelve were caught
in a day. But the lake was the great
resource.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Moodie and I used to rise by daybreak,
and fish for an hour after sunrise,
when we returned, he to the field, and I
to dress the little ones, clean up the
house, assist with the milk, and prepare
the breakfast. Oh, how I enjoyed those
excursions on the lake!&mdash;the very idea of
our dinner depending upon our success
added double zest to the sport."</p></blockquote>

<p>Even here there was some compensation.
The strange, Robinson-Crusoe-like
existence had its joys
as well as its sorrows. Who can
doubt that, seasoned by labour,
squirrel pie had, for the dwellers in
the forest, such savour as few epicures
find in pasty of choicest venison?
The warm breath of summer, too,
alleviated the hardships of the poor
emigrants. But winter came, and,
with winter, privation and misfortune.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The ruffian squatter P&mdash;&mdash;, from Clear
Lake, drove from the barn a fine young
bull we were rearing, and for several
weeks all trace of the animal was lost.
We had almost forgotten the existence
of poor Whisky, when a neighbour
called and told Moodie that his yearling
was at P&mdash;&mdash;'s, and that he would advise
him to get it back as soon as possible.
Moodie had to take some wheat to Y&mdash;&mdash;'s
mill, and as the squatter lived only a
mile farther, he called at his house; and
there, sure enough, he found the lost
animal. With the greatest difficulty he
succeeded in regaining his property, but
not without many threats of vengeance
from the parties who had stolen it. To
these he paid no regard; but a few days
after, six fat hogs, on which we depended
for all our winter store of animal food,
were driven into the lake and destroyed.
The death of these animals deprived us
of three barrels of pork, and half-starved
us through the winter. That winter of
'36, how heavily it wore away! The
grown flour, frosted potatoes, and scant
quantity of animal food, rendered us all
weak, and the children suffered much
from the ague."</p></blockquote>

<p>Under these circumstances, great
was the glee when a stray buck was
shot. Spot, Katie's pet pig, had to
be killed, in spite of the tears and
entreaties of its little owner, for the
family were craving after a morsel of
meat. Here is a melancholy note
in the diary of the emigrant's wife:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the 21st May of this year, my
second son, Donald, was born. The
poor fellow came in hard times. The
cows had not calved, and our bill of fare,
now minus the deer and Spot, only consisted
of bad potatoes, and still worse
bread. I was rendered so weak by
want of proper nourishment that my
dear husband, for my sake, overcame his
aversion to borrowing, and procured a
quarter of mutton from a friend. This,
with kindly presents from neighbours&mdash;often
as badly off as ourselves&mdash;a loin of
young bear, and a basket containing
loaf of bread, some tea, fresh butter,
and oatmeal, went far to save my life."</p></blockquote>

<p>Think of this, ye dainty dames,
who, in like circumstances, heap your
beds with feathers, and strew the
street with straw. Think of the chilly
forest, the windy log-house, the frosted
potatoes, the five children, the weary,
half-famished mother, the absence of
all that gentle aid and comfort which
wait upon your slightest ailment.
Think of all these things, and, if the
picture move you, remember that the
like sufferings and necessities abound
nearer home, within scope of your
charity and relief.</p>

<p>Quitting, for a while, the sad
catalogue of her woes, Mrs Moodie
launches forth into an episode which
fills one of the most characteristic
chapters of her work. In the midst
of these hard times, an Englishman&mdash;with
whom Captain Moodie had once
travelled in the mail to Toronto, and
whom he had invited to call on him,
should he come into his part of the
country&mdash;dropped in upon them one
evening, proposing to remain for the
night. He was their inmate for nine
months. Mrs Moodie disliked him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
from the very first day, for he was a
surly, discontented, reckless scamp,
but somehow there was no getting
rid of him. He grumbled over his
first meal of salt pork, dandelion
coffee, and heavy bread; and he
grumbled almost daily, until the
happy morning when he left them
for good and all. Malcolm (as Mrs
Moodie chooses to call him) told his
host that he was in hiding from the
sheriff's officers, and should esteem
it a great favour to be allowed to
remain a few weeks at his house.
The captain was far too good-natured
and hospitable to refuse his request.
"To tell you the truth, Malcolm,"
said he, "we are so badly off that we
can scarcely find food for ourselves
and the children. It is out of our
power to make you comfortable, or
to keep an additional hand, without
he is willing to render some little
help on the farm. If you can do
this, I will endeavour to get a few
necessaries on credit, to make your
stay more agreeable." The proposition
suited Malcolm to a hair. By
working for his keep, he got rid of
the obligation, and acquired a right
to grumble. As to the work he did,
it was really not worth speaking of.
Mrs Moodie had a sort of rude bedstead
made for him out of two large
chests, and put up in a corner of the
parlour. Upon that he lay, during
the first fortnight of his stay, reading,
smoking, and drinking whisky and
water from morning till night. There
was a mystery about the fellow which
he did not care fully to clear up, but
portions of his history oozed out.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He was the son of an officer in the
navy, who had not only attained a very
high rank in the service, but, for his gallant
conduct, had been made a Knight-Companion
of the Bath. He had himself
served his time as a midshipman on board
his father's flag-ship, but had left the
navy, and accepted a commission in the
Buenos-Ayrean Service during the political
struggles in that province. He had
commanded a sort of privateer under the
government, to whom, by his own account,
he had rendered many very signal services.
Why he left South America, and
came to Canada, he kept a profound
secret. He had indulged in very vicious
and dissipated courses since he came to
the province, and by his own account
had spent upwards of four thousand
pounds in a manner not over-creditable to
him.... He was now considerably
in debt. Money he had none; and, beyond
the dirty fearnought blue seaman's
jacket which he wore, a pair of trousers
of the coarse cloth of the country, an old
black vest that had seen better days, and
two blue-checked shirts, clothes he had
none. He shaved but once a week, never
combed his hair, and never washed himself.
A dirtier or more slovenly creature
never before was dignified by the title of
a gentleman. He was, however, a man
of good education, of excellent abilities,
and possessed a bitter sarcastic knowledge
of the world; but he was selfish
and unprincipled in the highest degree."</p></blockquote>

<p>This piratical sea-bear quarrelled
with Mrs Moodie's servants, disgusted
and offended her by his ungentlemanly
habit of swearing, and behaved altogether
so outrageously that any one
less forbearing and good-tempered
than Captain Moodie would have
turned him out of the house before he
had been a month in it. But the captain,
who lacked not spirit on occasion,
had Highland notions of hospitality;
and, moreover, he pitied the
unhappy scapegrace&mdash;whose vile temper
was his own greatest curse&mdash;and
bore with his infirmities. Malcolm
got the ague, and poor Mrs Moodie
nursed him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"During the cold fit, he did nothing
but swear at the cold, and wished himself
roasting; and, during the fever, he swore
at the heat, and wished that he was sitting
in no other garment than his shirt
on the north side of an iceberg."</p></blockquote>

<p>The only trait that somewhat reconciled
Mrs Moodie to her rude guest
was his affection for one of her children,
a merry golden-haired little boy.
When left alone with her in the house,
he almost frightened her by his
strange, sullen stare, and told her stories
about wild deeds of bloodshed
committed in his privateering days,
and was very anxious to read her a
manuscript work on South America,
for which Murray, he said, had offered
him a sum of money, but to which she
preferred not listening. At last he got
so indolent and insolent that Captain
Moodie was roused to anger, sharply
reproved him, and ordered him to be
gone. But it was not a trifle in the
way of rebuke that would drive Malcolm
from free bed and board. He
walked away for a few hours, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
then returned and joined the family
party, as if nothing had happened.
One day, however, a nickname applied
to him by Mrs Moodie's eldest girl
put him in a furious passion, and he
took himself off for ever, as his entertainers
hoped. They were mistaken.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Two months after, we were taking
tea with a neighbour, who lived a mile
below us on the small lake. Who should
walk in but Mr Malcolm? He greeted us
with great warmth, for him; and when we
rose to take leave, he rose and walked
home by our side. 'Surely the little
stumpy man (the name Katie had given
him) is not returning to his old quarters?'
I am still a babe in the affairs of men.
Human nature has more strange varieties
than any one menagerie can contain, and
Malcolm was one of the oddest of her odd
species. That night he slept in his old
bed below the parlour window, and for
three months afterwards he stuck to us
like a beaver."</p></blockquote>

<p>The manner of this strange being's
final departure was as eccentric as
that of his first coming. On Christmas
eve he started after breakfast to
walk into Peterborough to fetch raisins
for next day's pudding. He never
came back, but left Peterborough the
same day with a stranger in a waggon.
It was afterwards said that he had
gone to Texas, and been killed at
San Antonio de Bexar. Whatever
became of him, he never again was
seen in that part of Canada. Mrs
Moodie's account of his residence in
her house is full of character, and admirable
for its quietness and truth to
nature. "Firing the Fallow," and
"Our Logging Bee," are also, apart
from their connection with the emigrant's
fortunes, striking and interesting
sketches of Canadian forest life.
We are unable to dwell upon or extract
from them, and must hasten to
conclude our notice of this really fascinating
book.</p>

<p>Rebellion broke out in Canada.
Captain Moodie, although suffering
from a severe accident he had met
with whilst ploughing, felt his loyalty
and soldiership irresistibly appealed
to by the Queen's proclamation, calling
upon all loyal gentlemen to join
in suppressing the insurrection. Toronto
was threatened by the insurgents,
and armed bands were gathering
on all sides for its relief. So
Captain Moodie marched to the front.
Regiments of militia were formed, and
in one of them he received command
of a company. He left in January,
and Mrs Moodie remained alone with
her children and Jenny&mdash;a faithful
old Irish servant&mdash;to take care of the
house. It was a dull and cheerless
time. And yet her husband's appointment
was a great boon and
relief. His full pay as captain enabled
him to remit money home, and
to liquidate debts. His wife, on her
side, was not inactive.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Just at this period," she says, "I
received a letter from a gentleman, requesting
me to write for a magazine (the
<cite>Literary Garland</cite>) just started in Montreal,
with promise to remunerate me for
my labours. Such an application was
like a gleam of light springing up in the
darkness."</p></blockquote>

<p>When the day's toils&mdash;which were
not trifling&mdash;were over, she robbed
herself of sleep&mdash;which she greatly
needed&mdash;to labour with her pen;
writing by the light of what Irish
Jenny called "sluts"&mdash;twisted rags,
dipped in lard, and stuck in a bottle.
Jenny viewed these literary pursuits
with huge discontent.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You were thin enough before you
took to the pen," grumbled the affectionate
old creature&mdash;"what good will it
be to the children, dear heart! if you die
afore your time by wasting your strength
afther that fashion?"</p></blockquote>

<p>But Mrs Moodie was not to be
dissuaded from her new pursuit. She
persevered, and with satisfactory results.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I actually," she says, "shed tears of
joy over the first twenty-dollar note I
received from Montreal."</p></blockquote>

<p>Emulous of her mistress's activity,
Jenny undertook to make "a good
lump" of maple-sugar, with the aid
of little Sol, a hired-boy, whom she
grievously cuffed and ill-treated, when
he upset the kettle, or committed
other blunders. Every evening during
the sugar-making Mrs Moodie
ran up to see Jenny in the bush,
singing and boiling down the sap in
front of her little shanty.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The old woman was in her element,
and afraid of nothing under the stars;
she slept beside her kettles at night, and
snapped her fingers at the idea of the
least danger."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>The sugar-making was a hot and
wearisome occupation, but the result
was a good store of sugar, molasses,
and vinegar.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Besides gaining a little money with
my pen," writes Mrs Moodie at about this
time, "I practised a method of painting
birds and butterflies upon the white velvety
surface of the large fungi that grow
plentifully upon the bark of the sugar
maple. These had an attractive appearance;
and my brother, who was a captain
in one of the provisional regiments,
sold a great many of them among
the officers, without saying by whom
they were painted. One rich lady in
Peterborough, long since dead, ordered
two dozen to send as curiosities to England.
These, at one shilling each, enabled
me to buy shoes for the children, who,
during our bad times, had been forced to
dispense with these necessary coverings.
How often, during the winter season,
have I wept over their little chapped
feet, literally washing them with my
tears. But these days were to end. Providence
was doing great things for us;
and Hope raised at last her drooping
head, to regard, with a brighter glance,
the far-off future. Slowly the winter
rolled away; but he to whom every
thought was turned, was still distant
from his humble home. The receipt of an
occasional letter from him was my only
solace during his long absence, and we
were still too poor to indulge often in the
luxury."</p></blockquote>

<p>The spring brought work. Corn
and potatoes must be planted, and
the garden dug and manured. By
lending her oxen to a neighbour who
had none, Mrs Moodie obtained a
little assistance; but most of the labour
was performed by her and Jenny,
the greatest jewel of an old woman
the Emerald Isle ever sent forth to
toil in American wildernesses. A short
visit from the captain cheered the family.
In the autumn, he expected,
the regiment to which he belonged
would be reduced. This was a melancholy
anticipation, and his wife
again beheld cruel poverty seated on
their threshold. After her husband's
departure, the thought struck her that
she would write to the Governor of
Canada, plainly stating her circumstances,
and asking him to retain
Captain Moodie in the militia service.
She knew nothing of Sir George Arthur,
and received no reply to her
application. But the Governor acted,
though he did not write, and acted
kindly and generously. "The 16th
of October my third son was born;
and a few days after, my husband was
appointed paymaster to the militia
regiments in the V&mdash;&mdash; district, with
the rank and full pay of captain."
The appointment was not likely to be
permanent, and Mrs Moodie and the
children remained at their log-cabin
in the woods during the ensuing winter.
Malignant scarlet fever attacked
the whole family; a doctor was sent
for, but did not come; Mrs Moodie,
herself ill, had to tend her five children;
and when these recovered, she
was stretched for many weeks upon a
bed of sickness. Jenny, the most
attached of humble friends, and a
greater heroine in her way than many
whom poets have sung and historians
lauded, alone kept her suffering mistress
company in the depths of the
dark forest.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Men could not be procured in that
thinly-settled spot for love nor money;
and I now fully realised the extent of
Jenny's usefulness. Daily she yoked the
oxen, and brought down from the bush
fuel to maintain our fires, which she felled
and chopped up with her own hands. She
fed the cattle, and kept all things snug
about the doors; not forgetting to load
her master's two guns, 'in case,' as she
said, 'the ribels should attack us in our
retrate.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>What says the quaint old song?
that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The poor man alone, when he hears the poor moan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his morsel a morsel will give,<br /></span>
<span class="i24">Well-a-day!"<br /></span>

<p class="noind">It were a libel to adopt the sentiment
to its full extent, when we witness
the large measure of charity which
the more prosperous classes in this
country are ever ready to dispense to
the poor and suffering. But doubtless
the sympathy with distress is apt
to be heartiest and warmest on the
part of those who themselves have
experienced the woes they witness.
It is very touching to contemplate
Mrs Moodie walking twenty miles
through a bleak forest&mdash;the ground
covered with snow, and the thermometer
far below zero&mdash;to minister to
the necessities of one whose sufferings
were greater even than her own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Still more touching is the exquisite
delicacy with which she and her
friend Emilia imparted the relief they
brought, and strove to bestow their
charity without imposing an obligation.
"The Walk to Dummer" is a
chapter of Mrs Moodie's book that
alone would secure her the esteem and
admiration of her readers. Captain
N. was an Irish settler in Canada,
who had encountered similar mishaps
to those Captain Moodie had experienced&mdash;but
in a very different spirit.
He had taken to drinking, had deserted
his family, and was supposed
to have joined Mackenzie's band of
ruffians on Navy Island. For nine
weeks his wife and children had tasted
no food but potatoes; for eighteen
months they had eaten no meat. Before
going to Mrs Moodie, Jenny had
been their servant for five years, and,
although repeatedly beaten by her
master with the iron ramrod of his
gun, would still have remained with
them, would he have permitted her.
She sobbed bitterly on learning their
sufferings, and that Miss Mary, "the
tinder thing," and her brother, a boy
of twelve, had to fetch fuel from the
bush in that "oncommon savare
weather." Mrs Moodie was deeply
affected at the recital of so much
misery. She had bread for herself and
children, and that was all. It was
more than had Mrs N. But for the
willing there is ever a way, and Mrs
Moodie found means of doing good,
where means there seemed to be none.
Some ladies in the neighbourhood
were desirous to do what they could
for Mrs N.; but they wished first to
be assured that her condition really
was as represented. They would be
guided by the report of Mrs Moodie
and Emilia, if those two ladies would
go to Dummer, the most western
clearing of Canada's Far West, and
ascertain the facts of the case. <em>If</em> they
would! There was not an instant's
hesitation. Joyfully they started on
their Samaritan pilgrimage. Ladies,
lounging on damask cushions in your
well-hung carriages, read this account
of a walk through the wilderness;
read the twelfth chapter of Mrs Moodie's
second volume, and&mdash;having
read it&mdash;you will assuredly read
the whole of her book, and rise from
its perusal with full hearts, and with
the resolution to imitate, as far as
your opportunities allow&mdash;and to none
of us, who seek them with a fervent
and sincere spirit, shall opportunities
be wanting&mdash;her energetic and truly
Christian charity.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le diable ne sera pas toujours derrière
la porte</i>, says the French proverb.
The gentleman in question had
long obstinately kept his station behind
Mrs Moodie's shanty door; but
at last, despairing, doubtless, of a
triumph over her courage and resignation,
he fled, discomfited. The
militia disbanded, Captain Moodie's
services were no longer needed. But
his hard-saved pay had cleared off
many debts, and prospects were
brighter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The potato crop was gathered in, and
I had collected my store of dandelion
roots for our winter supply of coffee,
when one day brought a letter to my
husband from the Governor's secretary,
offering him the situation of Sheriff of the
V&mdash;&mdash; district. Once more he bade us
farewell; but it was to go and make
ready a home for us, that we should no
more be separated from each other.
Heartily did I return thanks to God
that night for all his mercies to us."</p></blockquote>

<p>Short time sufficed for preparation
to quit the dreary log-house. Crops,
furniture, farm-stock, and implements,
were sold, and as soon as snow fell
and sleighing was practicable, the
family left the forest for their snug
dwelling in the distant town of V&mdash;&mdash;.
Strange as it may seem, when the
time came, Mrs Moodie clung to her
solitude.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I did not like," she says, "to be
dragged from it to mingle in gay scenes,
in a busy town, and with gaily-dressed
people. I was no longer fit for the world;
I had lost all relish for the pursuits and
pleasures which are so essential to its
votaries; I was contented to live and die
in obscurity. For seven years I had lived
out of the world altogether; my person
had been rendered coarse by hard work
and exposure to the weather. I looked
double the age I really was, and my hair
was already thickly sprinkled with grey."</p></blockquote>

<p>Honour to such grey hairs, blanched
in patient and courageous suffering.
More lovely they than raven tresses,
to all who prefer to the body's perishable
beauty, the imperishable qualities
of the immortal soul!</p>

<h2><a name="THE_REFORM_MEASURES_OF_1852" id="THE_REFORM_MEASURES_OF_1852">THE REFORM MEASURES OF 1852.</a></h2>


<p>Lord John Russell's new measure
of Representative Reform has
resolved itself into the shape of a negation.
It is, perhaps, the most abortive
and unsatisfactory scheme that was
ever presented to the nation. It is not
good enough to be accepted by one
section of politicians, at least as a permanent
gift&mdash;not so utterly bad as to
excite the anger of another, though it
may well challenge their contempt.
It is not based upon any new principle&mdash;it
hardly even professes to alter
or improve any principle at present
acknowledged. It amounts to little
more than an arbitrary lowering of
the electoral qualification. Small
boroughs are to retain their privileges,
submitting only to an infusion of new
blood from villages in their respective
neighbourhoods. Large towns remain
as they were, but with a lower scale
of voters. So with counties. Every
man paying 40s. a-year of direct taxes
is to have a vote. This seems to be
the whole measure of reform as regards
constituencies. It is an alteration
in towns from £10 to £5, and in
counties from £50 to £20. For the
future, no property qualification is to
be required from members; and the
Parliamentary oaths are to be qualified,
so that every kind of unbeliever
may enter. The legislature ceases to
be Christian.</p>

<p>Considering that the scheme has
been brought forward by the Whigs
purely for party purposes, and to postpone,
if possible, their expected ejection
from office, we are surprised that
it is not more democratical. We leave
others to inquire why no second crusade
has been made against the close
boroughs&mdash;why Calne, for example,
and Arundel, and Tavistock, are not
to figure in a new schedule of disfranchisement.
We can conjecture sufficient
reasons, without pushing speculation
far. But&mdash;putting aside the
religious question, which Lord John
Russell has most indecorously mixed
up with a mass of electoral details&mdash;we
should really like to know what
party, or what class of men, this
measure is intended to satisfy. That
is, we must maintain, a consideration
of primary importance. All are agreed
that it is not for the benefit of the
nation that the constitution should
be perpetually tinkered. Even Lord
John does not broadly avow his predilection
for annual repairs; though,
in the true spirit of an itinerant metallurgist,
he proposes, in 1852, a new
solder for the constituencies of Ireland,
in place of that which he gratuitously
applied in 1851. If Parliaments
are habitually to reform themselves,
whether at the instigation or
against the will of ministers, it is
quite evident that all hope of discharging
the real business of the nation
is at an end. If repairs are
needed, let them by all means be
made; but let the work be done in
such a substantial manner that it
shall last for a given time, and not
subject us to the perpetual annoyance
of new experiments.</p>

<p>Now, we think it must strike every
one that the projected measure of the
present session is so far from being a
permanent settlement, that, if carried,
it must lead to an immense deal of
future agitation. The Radicals do
not even affect to deny this. They
express themselves disappointed with
the limited amount of the scheme.
They wish for the suppression of the
smaller boroughs, the enlargement of
the urban constituencies, electoral
divisions, household suffrage, vote by
ballot, and triennial, if not annual,
parliaments. These are their avowed
objects&mdash;for what ultimate purpose
we need not inquire; and they very
candidly state that they will not rest
satisfied until they obtain them.
They will accept Lord John Russell's
measure as an instalment, but nothing
more. They think that the lowering
of the franchise is a step in the right
direction, because they calculate that
it will give them more immediate
power, but they will not take it as a
settlement. Next year, if this bill
should be carried, though we hardly
think the Ministry will survive long
enough to reach it, they are again
to be in the field, busy, warlike, and
active as ever; and the agitation
is not to cease until their demands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
are satisfied. But will it cease even
then? Hardly. The Chartists have
the next turn, and they, too, doubtless,
will insist upon <em>their</em> schemes, all
the more practicable because the intervening
barriers have been taken
down. So that, if the peace and quiet
of the nation, and the real efficiency
of Parliament as a working and legislative
body, are worthy to be taken
into account, it appears that Lord
John Russell's measure will, if enacted,
neither promote the one nor the other.</p>

<p>Looking simply at the broad features
of the measure, with the reservation
which we have already made,
and without investigating the details,
a shallow observer might conclude that
it is calculated to do much immediate
mischief. We cannot style it a revolutionary
measure, simply because it
lowers the franchise from a point
which, twenty years ago, was arbitrarily
assumed, without any shadow
of reason, as the correct one. The
five-pounder may be, and often is,
quite as intelligent a person as the
ten-pounder. But where is the line
of demarcation to be drawn? If
property or rent is to be the qualification
and criterion, it must be drawn
somewhere, else there is no answer
to the Chartist; and if you once
begin the system of diminishment,
there is no possibility of any stoppage.
Tile electoral shillings are like
King Lear's hundred knights: they
will be beaten down until the final
question is asked, "What needs
one?" and then the triumph will be
complete.</p>

<p>Is this desirable? In the name of
everything sacred and dear to us&mdash;in
the name of intelligence, education,
and common sense, we answer, No!
We have but to look across the
Channel to see what are the effects of
universal suffrage; and surely there
is no man in this country infatuated
enough to wish that our free constitution
should be exchanged for alternate
anarchy and despotism. That
is not the wish of the nation&mdash;nay
more, we venture to say that it is not
the wish of the nation that any experiment
should be made tending in
the least degree towards any such
consummation. We have watched&mdash;most
attentively&mdash;for the last two
years, the movements of the so-called
reformers; and we are satisfied that,
had they been left to themselves, their
agitation must have died out as surely
as a fire expires for want of fuel.
The faggot-master, in the present instance,
has been her Majesty's Prime
Minister.</p>

<p>The electoral franchise is a privilege
which, for its own sake, is very
little coveted by the people of this
country. Even in the towns, men
who possess the qualification are exceedingly
backward to enrol themselves;
and often, when enrolled, they
positively decline to vote. A rush to
the poll, as every electioneering agent
knows, is seldom a spontaneous movement&mdash;indeed,
the general difficulty
is to overcome the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis inertiæ</i>. We
think this feeling may be carried too
far, but undoubtedly it exists; and
the proof of it is, that in most large
constituencies, but a small portion of
those who are qualified to vote appear
at the poll, except under circumstances
and on occasions of peculiar
excitement. Nay, more than this,
unless a case of very strong grievance
can be made out and established, it
is difficult to prevail upon the men of
the middle classes to lend their countenance
to or attend public meetings
for any political object.</p>

<p>The last general election did, in
reality, cause little excitement. The
conduct of Sir Robert Peel&mdash;we shall
not now call it his man&oelig;uvre&mdash;had
disposed of the question of Free Trade
for the time; and no one, whatever
might be his secret thoughts or forebodings,
wished for an immediate reversal
of that policy, until the effects
of the experiment became apparent.
Therefore a Free-Trade House of
Commons was returned, and the Ministry
had it all their own way.
Undoubtedly they have declined in
influence, since then. But why?
Simply because their policy was then
undergoing the test of experience,
and the result has proved adverse to
their anticipations. There is no other
reason. If it should be said that their
unpopularity is owing to the continuance
of the hated Income-tax, we
can only reply that Free-Trade and
the Income-tax are inseparable; and
that, so long as Sindbad chooses to
call himself a Free-Trader, he must
submit to carry the Old Man of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
Sea upon his shoulders. But the
constituencies were quiet. Except
when accidental elections took place,
which generally terminated in the
defeat of the ministerial candidates,
the electoral view could not be ascertained.
But there were held in every
county, and in the metropolis itself,
immense meetings of those who
thought themselves wronged by the
chicanery of a former Minister&mdash;not
demanding a readjustment of the
franchise, but simply requiring that
the general voice of the electoral body
might be taken on the subject of their
complaint. Thus the only classes in
the country who could allege a specific
and substantial grievance, were
utterly silent upon the subject of a
reform in the constitution. They had
faith in the justice of their cause, and
believed that, sooner or later, that
cause must prevail, without the intervention
of any violent remedy.</p>

<p>It was only in one or two of the
large towns that any attempt at agitation
for an increase of the suffrage
was made. For such agitation it
was difficult to find even a tolerable
pretext. According to the political
and commercial views of the reformers,
the system established in 1832
had worked wonderfully, nay, marvellously
well. They could, in fact,
point to no practical grievance affecting
life, liberty, or property, such as
could only be remedied by a strong
organic change. They could not accuse
the House of Commons of turning
a deaf ear to the representations of the
urban population. But as, in the
absence of reason, a pretext was
necessary, they reared one up in the
cry for economy and retrenchment.
Supposing that there had been any
grounds for such a demand, that our
national expenditure was too great,
and our finances unduly squandered,
it is difficult to understand the chain
of reason which connects the cure of
these things with a change in the
representative body. But, in truth,
nothing could be more monstrous
than such an allegation. When forced
to specify and particularise the nature
of their proposed reductions, the agitators
could only refer to our military
and naval establishments, and the
expense of our colonial empire. If
any doubt at all existed in the minds
of men as to such points, that doubt
has since been removed. After all
the trash that has been uttered at
Peace Congresses and Manchester
gatherings, it has become clear, even
to the meanest capacity, that our establishments,
instead of being too large,
are in reality too small, and insufficient
even for our defence! We have
no desire now to discuss such matters.
We allude to them simply for the
purpose of showing that the one pretext
of the would-be agitators for a
representative reform has given way
under their feet.</p>

<p>If the anticipations of those agitators
had been fulfilled&mdash;if they had
carried, as they proposed, a sweeping
measure of reform, based upon
household or universal suffrage&mdash;and
if, in consequence, the majority of the
House of Commons had consisted of
men professing the opinions of Mr
Cobden, and resolute to put them
into practice, into what a state of
anarchy and abject terror would this
country now have been thrown!
Without a fleet to scour the Channel,
without an army to defend our shores,
we should have been at the mercy of
almost any assailant. Yet such were
the results which Mr Cobden and his
friends distinctly contemplated, and
which they proposed to bring about
by lowering the franchise, and giving
a large accession of political power to
the manufacturing towns.</p>

<p>It is creditable to the sense of the
country that the agitation totally
failed&mdash;in fact, there never was any
agitation at all. The electors generally
abstained from giving countenance
to any meetings on the subject
of reform. Sir Joshua Walmsley and
Mr Joseph Hume undertook journeys
for the purpose of stirring up the
embers, but they nowhere could create
a blaze. Delegates, who represented
nobody but themselves, assembled at
Manchester, in the vain hope of hoaxing
the country into the belief that
there was a very general feeling in
favour of radical reform. They might
have spared themselves the trouble.
Never was there so ludicrous a
failure. The central English meeting
was held under such sorry auspices
that even Messrs Muntz and Scholefield,
the members for Birmingham,
declined to attend it. The conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
of the whole scheme reflected no
credit on the strategy of Mr John
Bright, who acted as generalissimo
on this occasion. The Edinburgh
meeting, held shortly afterwards, was,
in every sense of the word, contemptible.
With hardly any exceptions,
it was avoided and abjured by
every man of station, intelligence,
wealth, and respectability within the
city. In fact, the movement broke
down. The Radicals wished to demonstrate
that public feeling was
with them; and their demonstration
resulted in a clear proof that public
feeling was against them.</p>

<p>Radical reform, therefore, is clearly
not wanted, and would not be tolerated
by the nation. Lord John
Russell's measure, however, not being
violently radical in itself, though
convenient for the ulterior designs of
Radicalism, will doubtless be supported
by those who now perceive
that they cannot at present hope to
carry a broad scheme of democracy.
It is, therefore, proper that we should
consider whether any of the objections
that can be urged to the larger
scheme apply equally to the lesser one.</p>

<p>In our opinion, it will be impossible
for Lord John Russell to prove
the preamble of his bill. He certainly
has not established, as yet, the necessity,
or even the policy, of such a
change in our representative system;
nor can he hope to show that this
measure of his has been called for by,
or is calculated to meet, the requirements
of the great bulk of the community.
It is a gratuitous offering
on his part: no one has asked it at
his hand. Let us see, then, how he
attempts to justify his introduction of
this measure. To preface any measure
with a justification is impolitic,
because it implies the existence of a
serious doubt in the mind of the
speaker. He begins with one of
these rhetorical commonplaces which
has always a counterpart or opposite,
either of which may be selected, as
Aristotle tells us, according to the
option of the speaker. We shall quote
his own words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The state of affairs in which I bring
forward this motion ought to be satisfactory
to Parliament and to the country.
During four years we have seen the continent
of Europe torn by convulsions;
during that period the aspect of this
country has been tranquil, and any
threatened danger has been averted by
the general spirit and unanimous feeling
of the people. It appears to me that this
is a proper time for considering whether
any further extension can be given to the
right of voting, consistently with the
principles of the constitution, by which
the prerogatives of the Crown, the authority
of both Houses of Parliament, and
the rights and liberties of the people, are
equally secured."</p></blockquote>

<p>So far good. But we are almost
old enough to recollect the time when
the same speaker, on the occasion of
moving a previous measure of reform,
had recourse to the counterpart of
this commonplace. <em>Then</em> a reform in
the constitution was necessary because
the people were discontented;
<em>now</em>, a reform is necessary because
the people are contented. State the
proposition in any mode you please,
the argument resolves itself into that;
alter the argument, and you must
subtract from the present instance
the plea of necessity, and fall back
immediately upon the minor one of
expediency. But as neither the satyr
of the fable, nor the ventilating Dr
Reid, can compete with Lord John
Russell in the art of blowing hot or
cold as occasion requires, we need
hardly dwell upon this evident self-contradiction.
It is, however, not a
little remarkable, that he cautiously abstains
from averring that there has been
anything like a general demand for
an extension or alteration of the suffrage.
We confess that we were not
prepared for this abstinence. The
Whigs are not usually so scrupulous
in their statements, at least since they
began to enlist prosperity as a standing
argument on their side; therefore
it was with an agreeable surprise that
we marked Lord John's implied admission,
that nobody had thought it
worth their while to solicit that boon
which he was so gracious as to accord.
It is beyond a doubt that he was
wise in limiting himself thus. The
right and practice of petitioning Parliament
against any existing grievance
is well known to the people, and is
held <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in viridi observantia</i>. Can any
man believe that, if reform was really
and substantially the wish of a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
section of the community, the tables
of both Houses of Parliament would
not be groaning under the weight of
the accumulated mass of petitions?
Nothing of the kind has happened.
Such petitions as have been presented
to the House of Commons do not
pray for moderate and gradual reform,
but for universal suffrage, vote by
ballot, annual parliaments, electoral
districts, and all the other abominations
dear to the hearts of the in-dwellers
of Marylebone. The extension
they require is specific, not
couched in general terms. Lord
John's measure will receive from them
just the same consideration which
would be bestowed upon a cup of
milk and water, by an inveterate
gin drinker whose soul was bent upon
a dram. We are decidedly of opinion,
and will remain so until we have
proof to the contrary, that the class
which Lord John Russell now proposes
to enfranchise is supremely
indifferent to the privilege. We used
to be told that one particular reason
for fixing the limit of the franchise at
ten pounds, was the hope that the
possession of that right would be so
strongly desired, as to act as a wholesome
spur and incentive to industry.
That view seems to have been given
up. The people will not work up to
the franchise, so the standard of the
franchise is to be lowered to their
reach! Very convenient legislation
this, but somewhat slovenly withal.</p>

<p>If, then, we are correct in our premises,
Lord John Russell is volunteering
a measure, which is asked for
by nobody, which will satisfy nobody,
and which, so far from settling the
question permanently, must be regarded
as a stimulus to farther agitation.
He is, although he may not
know it himself, on the highway to
universal suffrage. People had begun
to consider the ten pound clause in
the old Reform Bill as something
equivalent to a principle&mdash;now, her
Majesty's chief adviser unsettles that
faith, descends fifty per cent, and
proclaims to the world that a further
discount may probably be expected,
if a material increase shall take place
in the circulation of newspapers and
periodicals, thereby, as supposes,
testifying the augmented intelligence
of the nation! It is really no laughing
matter. Such was one of the
leading arguments of the Prime Minister
of Great Britain in justification of
his scheme, and we can only hope
that it was founded upon intense
ignorance of the state of our present
periodical literature. That the elements
of education&mdash;that is, the power
of reading and writing&mdash;are more
generally diffused among the lower
orders than formerly may be true,
though we greatly doubt it; but that
has nothing to do with the question
at issue. No argument is required to
convince us that some of the class
which the noble Lord intends to admit
to the franchise, possess much more
than the mere rudiments of education;
the question ought to be, whether
what they do read is likely to fit
them for discharging the important
duty of selecting and sending proper
representatives to Parliament. Let
Lord John Russell, or any other
legislator who may be of his way of
thinking, but take the trouble to send
to Manchester or Birmingham for
weekly sets of the political, religious,
literary, and moral miscellanies,
which are most eagerly bought up
and perused&mdash;let them read those
carefully through, and consider well
their tenor&mdash;and we are satisfied that
the sturdiest advocate for progression
would shudder to commit the
fate of his country to men who were
daily and weekly imbued with the
principles inculcated by such publications.
It is utterly absurd to talk of
the mere increase of schools, as if
such increase implied education in
the proper sense of the word. At the
schools a boy is taught to read and
write, but he is not taught, and never
can be taught, what he ought to read,
and what he ought to abstain from
reading hereafter. His mind is
simply made photographic. He can
take in and retain the ideas of others;
and, unfortunately, the expressed
ideas which come most naturally,
easily, and perhaps most palatably
within his reach, are precisely those
which are most dangerous to his
morals, and most likely to give him
false views of society, and to unfit
him for a proper discharge of his
duties alike as a Christian and a subject.
Lord John Russell, we are
thoroughly convinced, is at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
moment entirely ignorant of the kind
of literature which is current among,
and greedily devoured by the operative
classes. It is no wonder that such
should be the case. We confess,
quite frankly, that our attention was
drawn to the subject, not much more
than two years ago, by certain representations
made by publishers on
the subject of the paper duty as
affecting popular publications. Being
unable to reconcile their statements
with certain facts which came under
our own knowledge, we thought it
advisable to institute an inquiry,
and in the course of that we collected
copies of such works as were most
generally circulated among the working
classes. We are most happy to
admit that some of them were entirely
unexceptionable in their tone and
doctrine. Many men are working
among the operative classes with a
true knowledge of their calling, and
a sincere and devout intention to
dedicate themselves to the task of
raising the minds of the people, by
inculcating sound principles of economy,
morality, and healthful and
religious feelings. But these constitute
the exceptions, not the rule.
The political journals which have the
largest circulation are something
more than Radical; they are, if not
avowedly, at least in spirit, republican.
The Peerage and the Established
Church are the institutions
which they assail with the most undisguised
ferocity; and no means
which falsehood can suggest are left
unemployed to turn both into contempt,
and to inflame the minds of
the people against the aristocracy
and the clergy. Personality, vituperation,
and ignorance, are the characteristics
of those journals. Lord
John Russell, we suspect, would
hardly have ventured to lay so much
stress upon this educational argument,
had he been aware of the manner
in which he is habitually mentioned
by those oracles of the lower
orders. We have read descriptions
of and commentaries upon himself,
his character, and his measures, which
assuredly were the reverse of flattering,
as they were clearly calumnious
and wicked. Several of the works of
fiction, which are most greedily
bought up, are utterly loathsome and
depraved. The public appetite is not
to be sated, as in days gone by, with
mere melodramic romance, and tales
of the wild and wonderful&mdash;there
must be a relish of cantharides in the
dish in order to make it palatable.
We seldom hear anything nowadays
of our old friends, the benevolent
robber, the mysterious monk, the
misanthropical count, or the persecuted
damsel&mdash;these characters belonged
to past times; our caterers
for the public taste deal exclusively
with the present. The nobleman of
these fictions, whether he be old or
young, is invariably a profligate and a
seducer. No imaginable combinations
of vice are too revolting for him&mdash;no
villany too hideous to deter him.
The heroine usually is "a daughter
of the people," who sometimes successfully
resists and sometimes falls
a victim to the arts of the noble miscreant.
But in either case, she is
compelled to go through various
stages of temptation and trial, which
are described in glowing colours.
Brothels, both public and private,
are represented with an abominable
minuteness of detail. So are clubs
and gambling-houses, in which the
aristocracy are represented as squandering
the hard-won earnings of the
poor. Compared with such writers,
Eugene Sue appears almost a pattern
of austere morality; and we believe
that no man who has had the curiosity
to inspect his works can misunderstand
the force of that observation.
Then there are biographies, in which
the modern Plutarch gives a detailed
and circumstantial account of such
worthies as O'Connor who was murdered
by the Mannings, giving due
prominence to his personal intrigues
from boyhood downwards. For the
younger portion of the community
there are cheap editions of pickpocket
prowess, both in the narrative
and the dramatic form, and enticing
details of the exploits of divers other
ruffians and burglars. All of these
publications are illustrated by woodcuts,
some of which, though not by
any means the majority, display a
considerable degree of artistical accomplishment.</p>

<p>Such is the favourite reading of
the lower orders&mdash;such the practical
application of their boasted educational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
powers. Unless education can
go beyond this, we regard it not
as a blessing, but as a curse. This
is not the kind of liberty of the
press which was contended for by
Milton&mdash;it is a base license, calculated
to deprave the morals, and
pervert the understanding of the
people. If the case be as we have
stated it&mdash;if it is an undeniable fact
that such are the doctrines and views
inculcated by some of those publications
which have an immense sale in
the manufacturing districts&mdash;surely
we may be excused if we hesitate
to admit that the education of the
lower orders is such that they can
be safely intrusted with the franchise.
It is not true that they are
compelled to take this kind of
literary diet for lack of better food.
With them it is absolute choice.
There are, as we have already said,
many cheap journals and publications
of an unexceptionable character,
but, unless our information is
altogether erroneous, these are neglected
and put aside for the others
of a vicious tendency.</p>

<p>Now, it does appear to us, though
we shall be glad to be informed
to the contrary, that the qualification
which Lord John Russell proposes
to establish in the towns and
boroughs will admit a large proportion
of the class for which such publications
are intended, to the possession
of the franchise. We are sure,
at all events, that it will bring in
a large mass of those whose political
opinions are represented by the
<cite>Weekly Despatch</cite>. Indeed, it seems
to us very like household suffrage
under another name. If we take a
house rated at the annual value of
£5, we shall find that the tenant
of it is paying only 2s. 6d. per week,
which appears to be very nearly the
minimum of rent in large towns.
If the reader will look at Mr
Mayhew's interesting and instructive
work, <cite>London Labour and the
London Poor</cite>, he will find in the 42d.
number, at page 231, a statement
of the rent usually paid by the operative
scavengers of the metropolis.
Mr Mayhew gives us two estimates
of the rent of those who have regular
work and pay&mdash;the one being 3s.,
and the other 3s. 6d. per week.
Now, it must be obvious that a
qualification which admits the scavenger,
can hardly exclude any one
else; so that, in reality, in so far
as regards towns, it would be difficult
to push democracy further. We
should like to ask Lord John Russell
if he really and sincerely believes
that the scavengers, as a class,
are proper, fit, and competent persons
to return members to Parliament?
It is very easy to talk in
general terms about the growing
intelligence and increasing education
of the people; but we should much
prefer, in a matter of this sort, to
be instructed by actual facts. We
are not of opinion that the lower
classes in this country are better
educated or more enlightened than
they were formerly; and we have
been unable to find any evidence
at all to justify such an assertion.
What evidence does exist upon the
subject leads us to form a conclusion
directly opposite; and we beg to
draw the attention of our readers
to the following tables. The first
shows the number of criminals
throughout England and Wales who
could neither read nor write. The
investigation embraces a period of
ten years&mdash;from 1839 to 1848 inclusive&mdash;the
average annual number
of criminals being 27,542:&mdash;</p>

<p>Here, certainly, there are no signs
of educational improvement; on the
contrary, the last year, with but one exception,
exhibits the greatest amount
of ignorance. But in case this list
should not be thought a fair one, it
being quite possible that education
may not yet have penetrated so low
as the class of society which affords
the largest contribution to crime, let
us adopt another, which is liable to
no such exception. The following is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>

<p>The result of the whole is, that out
of every hundred persons married
during the above years in England
and Wales, <em>forty could not write their

was much greater than in 1839!</p>

<p>Really, with these facts before us,
we cannot but wonder at the temerity
of Lord John Russell in using the
following language on the occasion of
the introduction of his measure:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But there is another ground which
I confess has great influence on my
mind, and it was that ground which
formed a case for the original proposition
of reform in 1822, namely, the growing
intelligence and education of the
people. <em>I could prove, if I were not afraid
of wearying the House by going into statistics&mdash;I
could show</em> by the number of
newspapers and of books, by the great
number of schools established since 1831,
that a great increase has taken place in
intelligence among the people. <em>But I
do not think the proof necessary</em>, as the
experience of every honourable member
is sufficient to induce him to concur in
my statement, and to say that the franchise
given in 1831 might be made more
extensive at the present time."</p></blockquote>

<p>Why did he not prove it? Certain
we are of this, that the House of
Commons would neither have shown
nor felt any weariness at listening to
statistics which could satisfactorily
establish that the people of this country
were rising in the scale of intelligence.
But it was utterly impossible
for Lord John Russell, dexterous as
he is, to prove facts which have no
foundation. He durst not appeal to
such tests as that afforded by the register
of marriages; and therefore he
calmly assumes "intellectual improvement,"
just as his colleagues were in
the habit of assuming "prosperity,"
without any substantial proof; and
he applies for corroboration to that
most unsatisfactory source, "the experience
of every honourable member"!
We say, however, that this
is a matter in which no juggling or
evasion can be allowed. The question
of lowering the suffrage is one of
the deepest importance to the nation;
and if Lord John Russell rests, as he
undoubtedly does, the greater part of
his case upon the increased intelligence
of the nation, he must prove
that, if he can, to the entire satisfaction
of the country, and we challenge
him to do it. But it is quite evident
that the noble lord has no confidence
in his own statement. Towards the
close of his speech we find him using
the following language, which we
cannot regard as altogether consistent
with the passage which we have already
quoted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sir, I trust that when this enlarged
franchise is given, we shall next see the
government of this country, in whosesoever
hands it be, consider most seriously and
earnestly the great question of the education
of the people. <em>This question of the
franchise is not alien from that other one
of providing that the instruction, the education
of the people, should be in a better
state than it now is.</em> I am convinced that
if, after a measure of this kind, in another
session of Parliament, this House shall
consider the means of establishing a
really national system of education, they
will confer one of the greatest blessings
which can be conferred upon this country;
a measure for which, I believe, the people
are now almost prepared, and which,
after further discussion, I do trust might
be carried with very nearly a general
assent."</p></blockquote>

<p>Surely it must occur to every one
to ask why the noble philanthropist,
entertaining such strong and generous
views on the subject of national education,
has delayed so very long reducing
them to a practical form?
Instead of consuming the last session
in fruitless debates to carry through
the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, the provisions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
of which have already become
a dead letter, to the gross scandal
and positive detriment of the cause of
Protestantism, Lord John Russell
might have occupied himself wisely
and profitably by promoting the general
advancement of education
throughout the country. We fear,
however, that his present educational
zeal is not one whit more earnest and
real than his indignation against
Papal aggression. We are getting
used to these promissory notes of the
noble lord, as also to his accommodation
bills, which sometimes are drawn
to supersede them. We know quite
well what purpose is intended to be
served by his hints of grand national
improvements to be proposed "in
another session of Parliament." The
purpose is Whig supremacy, and the
perpetuation of that family and oligarchical
alliance which is the sole principle
of the present Ministry. But,
supposing him to be in earnest, what
sort of a logician does he prove himself?
If education is, or ought to be,
one of the conditions of the franchise,
what shall we say to the man who
first gives the franchise and then proposes
to educate? This certainly is
the most notable instance which we
have seen in our day of that process
which is properly expressed by the
metaphor of "putting the cart before
the horse." Undoubtedly the question
of the franchise is not alien from
that of the education of the people&mdash;knowledge
and power may very well
go hand in hand together; but in this
instance Lord John Russell proposes
to give the power first, and to impart
the knowledge at some more convenient
season. In our view, it
would be quite as rational a proceeding
to intrust the conduct of a railway
engine and train, to a party wholly ignorant
of the nature of the machinery,
on the understanding that, at some
future period, he was to acquire a
knowledge of its working!</p>

<p>May we be allowed to express, with
all humility&mdash;although in doing so we
may be subjected to the charge of being
behind the march of modern intellect&mdash;our
very serious doubts whether
the class which Lord John Russell
proposes to enfranchise, is, on the
whole, adequate to the proper discharge
of the electoral duties? It
may be a prejudice upon our part,
but we cannot think that a scavenger
or a dustman is as likely to form a
correct opinion of the qualities which
ought to recommend a candidate as
the man who has enjoyed the advantages
of a superior education. We
hesitate to put the costermonger on
an exact political equality with the
philosopher. We think, for the sake
of the general welfare and security,
that he should not be so placed;
because it is very obvious that, if this
bill passes into a law, the general
average intelligence of the electors
will be greatly lowered, and a fearful
preponderance given to the unlettered
over the lettered classes. Below a
certain point you cannot expect to
find generally such a degree of imparted
intelligence&mdash;though you may
find much natural shrewdness&mdash;as
ought to prevail among those who are
intrusted with political power. Therefore
we cannot but regard the urgent
and admitted necessity for general
education as a direct argument
against the arbitrary lowering of the
franchise; and we further think, that
the franchise, if conferred in this way,
will, in many cases, be morally detrimental
to the people who receive it.
We all know that, under the present
system, corrupt practices have prevailed
to a very odious extent. The
late disclosures at St Albans show us
that bribery is more common and
widely diffused than any one would
willingly believe; and there are good
grounds for suspecting that even the
metropolis of England is not altogether
untainted. The mischief has
become chronic. There are places,
possessing the privilege of returning
members to Parliament, in which the
vote of almost every man is rated at
a certain sum; and unless a candidate
is willing to satisfy these demands, he
may as soon hope to stop the Thames
as to succeed in the object of his
ambition. This is a monstrous evil;
but we cannot see how it is to be
cured by the admission of a new
class of electors, more straitened
in circumstances, and therefore more
liable to be swayed by pecuniary
influence, than even the older one.
The bribery will continue; the number
of the bribed will be enlarged;
but the dividend per head will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
smaller. Now, we entertain very
strong opinions upon this same matter
of bribery. We hold it to be the
foulest blot in the working of the
British Constitution; and we say advisedly,
that nothing can be done to
purify the system, short of an enactment
enforcing rigorous pains and
penalties, both on those who are
proved to have tendered, and on
those who are proved to have accepted,
a bribe. There is no other
way of dealing with corruption. Under
the ballot&mdash;which many of the
Radical reformers represent as a sure
and certain check, but which we hope,
for the sake of manhood and truth,
will never be enacted&mdash;bribery could
most easily be reduced to a system of
organised betting. What could be
simpler than for an agent, if the ballot
were in operation&mdash;thus, be it remarked,
precluding the possibility of
an after inquiry&mdash;to offer bets of a
certain amount to every man on the
roll, that Mr So-and-so would <em>not</em> be
returned, naming the opponent of his
employer, and paying these, very honourably,
whenever the event came off?
The present bill does nothing whatever
to prevent bribery; and although
the "Corrupt Practices at Elections
Bill," which has also been introduced,
may facilitate an inquiry into the
peculiar circumstances of any suspicious
case, we greatly doubt the
soundness of the principle upon which
it professes to be based. Lord John
Russell's view seems to be shortly
this, that when it can be shown that
corrupt practices prevail, the offending
borough or constituency is to be
disfranchised, and its privileges transferred
to some other place which is
not at present represented. He assumes
that bribery prevails only in
small boroughs, and he looks upon
these as a fund which, some time or
other, will become available for the supply
of towns which ought, from their
importance, to have a further share
in the representation. We doubt both
the accuracy and the morality of this
view. Bribery is not confined to small
constituencies; it has been practised
largely in others. The only constituency
in Scotland known positively to
be tainted, numbers between 1800 and
1900 electors. Is London itself so
virginal that no suspicion has been
raised as to the purity of its electoral
fame? We can hardly believe that it
was made the subject of an unfounded
calumny. Now, if justice is at all to
be observed in matters of this sort, it
is difficult, nay impossible, to understand
why small corrupt constituencies
are to be disfranchised, while larger
ones are to be allowed to escape unpunished.
And what is to be the
criterion for disfranchisement? Let
us suppose the case of a constituency
of 2000, whereof one-half are proved
to be bribed&mdash;a number more than
sufficient to pervert the true expression
of that constituency's opinion&mdash;are
the remaining thousand electors,
who have not participated in such
practices, to be deprived of their
privilege on account of the sins of
their neighbours? This, we apprehend,
would be neither just, politic,
nor practicable; yet, if we understand
him aright, Lord John Russell proposes
to adopt this method with regard
to small constituencies. Then
again, it is alleged that there are
places which, from their growing importance,
ought to have representatives.
If so, surely the present was
the proper time to have supplied that
want. There would have been but
Petty regret for the extinction of
Calne and divers other places, which,
by some miracle or other, escaped
disfranchisement twenty years ago,
and which do not represent any
interest, public or private, entitled
to Parliamentary consideration. As
it is, the "places of growing importance"&mdash;we
wish we had been favoured
with an accurate list of these&mdash;must
wait until the corruption
alleged to exist in the smaller
boroughs shall extend itself to the
villages which are now hung on as
pendants, and until the taint is no
longer endurable by a human nostril.
Is there not something grossly absurd
and unstatesmanlike in the proposition,
which would make places of admitted
importance dependent for their
chance of representation on the possible
increase of corruption?</p>

<p>We do not deny that there are
several anomalies in the present distribution
of representation, but not
one of these is touched by the provisions
of this measure. We are clearly
of opinion that it would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
far better for the interests of the
country had matters been allowed to
remain undisturbed. It is plain that
there was no general call for such a
measure; and we have already pointed
out several most serious objections
to the proposed lowering of the franchise
in the burghs. But if the question
of reform of the representation is
really to be taken up, it should be
approached in a very different spirit
from that which seems to have dictated
this slovenly and imperfect
scheme. The whole system should
be considered and examined from its
very foundation; and, in particular,
the soundness of the principle which
makes the possession of the suffrage
depend upon a property qualification
ought to be deliberately discussed.
Several schemes, which have been proposed
during the last year or two, are
deserving of serious thought. One
of these, suggested by Mr Stapleton,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
formerly the private secretary of Mr
Canning, is, at all events, worth consideration,
and is certainly much preferable
to a plan for bestowing power
upon ignorance. He proposes that a
considerable number of members of the
House of Commons, from eighty to a
hundred, should be returned by the
different learned professions, and large
public institutions, just as is presently
done in the case of the universities.
He says, with much show of truth,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Is it not then a matter of extreme
wonder that, in a legislature consisting of
six hundred and fifty-six members, only
six should be returned by the <em>learning</em>
and <em>education</em> of the nation? Is it not
unaccountable, that when the body of the
old House of Commons was thrown by
the Medeas of the day into their seething
cauldron of reform, in order to infuse into
its aged limbs livelier and more vital
powers, it should never have occurred
to these daring men to create some
constituencies composed exclusively of
educated persons above the suspicion of
bribery, who would select their representatives
for no other motives than that
they believed them to be the best men at
once to understand and to promote the
imperial interests of Britain's almost
boundless dominions? But is not this
still more extraordinary when there existed
no need for the creation of such
bodies, seeing that they existed already
made to their hands; seeing that they
are to be found in all the professions to
which English gentlemen belong?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Stapleton then proceeds to give
an outline of his plan, which we need
not discuss, because, under present
circumstances, we deprecate any
change whatever, on the general
ground that no change is wanted by
the nation. It is impossible that any
kind of constitution can be made
absolutely perfect; and therefore,
when we have a constitution which,
at all events, is satisfactory to the
majority, we see no reason to disturb
it. We have no objection to amendments
which do not infringe upon a
principle already laid down, and
tacitly acquiesced in by all parties;
indeed, we shall presently have to
notice some amendments which might
advantageously be introduced with
regard to the representation of Scotland;
but we do so solely because
Ministers have insisted upon making
themselves agitators, and have, therefore,
in a manner, forced the discussion
upon us. We do not think a new
Reform Bill necessary; and we very
much doubt whether this one will be
read a second time; nevertheless, as
it has been introduced, we are justified
in pointing out such obvious improvements
as might be made without
any lowering of the franchise.</p>

<p>We do not pretend to possess that
degree of information which would
justify us in criticising the details of
the English Reform Bill, introduced
specially by the Premier. We shall
say nothing of the tinkering process
which he proposes to apply to
the lesser boroughs, or of the curious
selection of the places which
are set down in the schedule by way
of additions to them. We are not
qualified from personal knowledge to
speak of those matters, but we rejoice
to observe that the subject is in the
hands of that practised anatomist,
<cite>The Times</cite>, whose dissection, so far
as it has gone, is an exposition of insufferable
corruption. But we have a
word or two to say regarding the new
Reform Bill for Scotland, to which we
earnestly entreat the attention of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
countrymen, whatever may be their
shade of political opinion. We regard
the matter as a national one of the
utmost importance; and we shall try
to approach it without any feeling of
prejudice.</p>

<p>Of late years there has been a prevalent
feeling in Scotland, that this
portion of the United Kingdom did
not receive full justice in the distribution
of representatives which was
made in 1832. That view has been
over and over again stated and illustrated
in journals widely differing
from each other in general politics, but
agreeing as to that particular point;
and we shall presently have occasion
to notice some of the leading arguments
which were employed. We
think it, however, right to say, that
the entire change which was made in
the Scottish representative system
by the act of 1832, rendered it very
difficult for the framers of that measure
to calculate with certainty on its
results. They had few data from
which they might calculate the probable
amount of the constituencies;
and it is quite possible that they
thought it safest, in the case of a population
hitherto unused to open elections,
to be parsimonious rather
than liberal in the allotment of the
members.</p>

<p>But twenty years have since then
gone by. The people of Scotland are
now as well used to elections as their
southern neighbours; and it is admitted
on all hands that intelligence
and education are at least as widely
diffused in this country as elsewhere.
Therefore, now that the question of
reform has been again brought forward,
and a new bill introduced for
amending our representation, it is incumbent
upon us to consider whether
the allotment of members made to
Scotland is a just one; and that we can
only ascertain by instituting a comparison
with certain constituencies of
England. We must be very cautious
in doing so, to avoid exaggeration of
any kind, and not to leap at rash conclusions
by contrasting the constituency
of this or that small English
borough with a large Scottish one,
possessing the same amount of political
power. We must remember that
there are many anomalies even in the
English representation; and we must
not try to make out a stronger case
than we really have, by setting, for
example, Calne, with its 159 electors,
against the populous county of Perth
with 4806 on the roll. We have
overwhelming arguments on our side
for an increase of the representation,
if it should be determined that any
kind of change is to be made, without
having recourse to extremes.</p>

<p>We shall consider this matter simply
on its own merits, without any reference
whatever to the proposed increase
of the franchise; our observations
upon that point being applicable
alike to the constituencies of England
and of Scotland. We shall take the
electoral rolls as they stand at present,
and state our case from them.</p>

<p>By the Reform Act of 1832, every
English county returns at least two
members to Parliament&mdash;many of
them possess a larger privilege. Yorkshire
has six members; twenty-five
counties, being divided, send four each;
seven have the privilege of three.</p>

<p>No Scottish county returns more
than a single member to Parliament;
the number of the whole being precisely
that which was fixed by the
Act of Union.</p>

<p>Now, if, in 1832, no addition had
been made to the English county representation,
we should perhaps have
no reason to complain. But such
addition was made, to a very large
extent; and now that a period of accounting
has come, at the instance of
the Prime Minister, it is our duty to
see that, if there is to be a change at
all, we are at least allowed something
like a measure of justice.</p>

<p>Let us take the case of ten Scottish
counties returning only <em>ten</em> members:&mdash;</p>

<p>Here is an aggregate constituency,
almost exactly equal in amount; and
yet the number of members returned
by the English is precisely double of
that returned by the Scottish counties.</p>

<p>This is a monstrous inequality; and
it cannot be defended by reference to
other anomalies. There can be no
reason why Perthshire should not
stand at least on an equality with
Rutland, or why the metropolitan
county of Scotland should not be put
upon an equality with it. If the
Tweed is to be an imaginary boundary,
not separating two distinct nations,
but flowing through one cordially
united&mdash;and if, again, we are
called upon, even partially, to remodel
the constitution&mdash;let this enormous
discrepancy in political power be
immediately remedied, as remedied it
can be, if Lord John Russell chooses
to deal with the trash of small English
boroughs as he ought to do. We, on
our side, would have no objection
whatever to make concessions. One
or two of our Scottish counties are,
in point of population and constituency,
hardly worthy of the name.
Bute, which was separated from
Caithness in 1832, and which has
only a constituency of 491, principally
derived from the little town of Rothesay,
might conveniently be incorporated
with Dumbartonshire. Sutherland,
with a wretched constituency of
207, ought certainly to be annexed to
its nearest neighbour, Caithness; and,
if further consolidation were required,
Selkirk might be annexed to Peebles.
In this way, only seven additional
seats would be required to satisfy the
just claims of the leading Scottish
counties&mdash;claims which, if not satisfied
just now, since the Whig Ministry
have chosen to unsettle existing
arrangements, will certainly be preferred
hereafter, with possibly less
temperance of tone than would be
proper on the present occasion.</p>

<p>If the case needs further elucidation,
we shall be glad to elucidate it.
Without descending to the small English
boroughs which return one member
each, here is a list of twenty, each
of which returns <em>two</em> members. The
number of the constituency in none
of them reaches 400; and we do not
believe that any man in the country
will maintain that the best of them is
entitled to the same consideration
which should be given to Perthshire
or Mid-Lothian.</p>

<p>It cannot, even on the ground of
other existing anomalies in the representation,
be considered fair that
twenty English boroughs, none of
which are of any separate importance,
should, with an aggregate constituency
of only 6264, return to Parliament
<em>ten members more than are
allowed to the whole counties of Scotland</em>,
the constituency of which
amounts to 50,943.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>With regard to the Scottish burghs,
fewer changes are required; but three
at least, whose constituency is above
2000, ought to possess the same privilege
as Edinburgh and Glasgow, of
returning two members each. These
are&mdash;</p>

<p>Surely this is a reasonable demand.
The great importance of these towns,
as seats of manufacture and commerce,
cannot be denied; and it is not just
that their interests should be disregarded
for the sake of maintaining
intact a few nomination boroughs in
the South.</p>

<p>Since the passing of the Reform Bill
of 1832, two manufacturing towns in
the south of Scotland have greatly
increased in importance. These are
Hawick and Galashiels. We would
propose that these towns, along with
Peebles and Innerleithen, should be
erected into a new group of burghs,
with the privilege of returning one
member to Parliament. In this way,
the constituency of Roxburghshire,
now amounting to 2033, would be
reduced below the point of 2000, which
we have assumed, both in counties
and burghs, as the number entitling
us to demand an increase of representation;
and the principal objections
to the amalgamation of Peebles
and Selkirk counties would at once
be removed.</p>

<p>Finally, we would urge upon the
legislature, in the event of any organic
change being seriously discussed in
Parliament, as a measure not less of
expediency than of justice, the propriety
of giving a fair representation
to the Scottish universities. It is not
creditable to the learning of this
country, and not conducive to the
welfare of these important national
institutions, that they should be placed
on a lower footing than the universities
of the other kingdoms. As a
proof of the detrimental effects of this
neglect, we may state the notorious
fact, that so far back as the year 1826,
a Royal Commission was issued for
the inspection and visitation of the
Scottish universities. The visitation
was held; an immense mass of information
was collected; and, after an
inquiry of unusual duration, the whole
proceedings of the Commissioners,
along with detailed reports, were
printed and laid before Parliament.
Since then, not the slightest notice
has been taken of these reports, nor
any effect given to the recommendations
of the Commissioners&mdash;a circumstance
which we can only attribute
to the utterly unrepresented state of
the universities. Let the Scottish
universities, therefore, be adequately
represented; St Andrews being combined
for electoral purposes with Edinburgh,
and the two Colleges of Aberdeen
with the University of Glasgow.
In this way, by the addition of two
members, the learning of Scotland
would have a direct voice in the
legislature.</p>

<p>Such is the nature of the Reform Bill
which, in our humble opinion, ought
to have been introduced for Scotland,
supposing that any change in the
existing system was really advisable.
It would be a very perilous experiment
indeed to lower the franchise here,
especially in the burghs. Our constituencies,
we are glad to say, have
hitherto, with scarcely any exception,
maintained their character for purity,
a circumstance which we attribute
very much to the non-existence among
them of a class corresponding to the
freemen and potwallopers. But to
descend lower in the scale would be
to invite the very evil from which
Lord John Russell professes to recoil
in horror. We need not, however,
again enforce that division of our
argument. If there is to be any
reform at all, it should be a substantial,
not a theoretical one; and in
dealing with the Scottish measure we
have attempted to point out the real
improvements which ought to be
made on the existing arrangements,
without departing in any way from
the spirit or principles of the Reform
Act of 1832.</p>

<p>Let us shortly recapitulate our
views with regard to Scottish Reform.</p>

<p>We would give to ten counties, the
constituency of each of which is at
present above 2000, an additional
member each.</p>

<p>We would give to three burghs,
with the same amount of constituency,
an additional member each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>We would erect a new group of
burghs, with the privilege of returning
one member.</p>

<p>We would give the Scottish universities
the right of returning two
members.</p>

<p>This would imply an addition of
sixteen members to Scotland; but
there are three counties which, from
their proximity to others, and the
smallness of their constituencies,
might well be amalgamated, just as
Ross is at present with Cromarty,
Clackmannan with Kinross, and Elgin
with Nairn. The numbers of the
amalgamated constituencies would
stand as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="amalgamated">
  <tr>
    <td align="left">Dumbarton and Bute,</td>
    <td align="right">1805</td>

  <tr>
    <td align="left">Caithness and Sutherland</td>
    <td align="right">49</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="left">Peebles and Selkirk,</td>
    <td align="right">905</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

<p class="noind">with some slight deduction in the
latter case for the small towns separated
from the counties, and erected
into a group of burghs along with
Hawick.</p>

<p>Thus, only thirteen new members
would be required for Scotland; and
surely, when we limit our demand so
far as to desire no additional representation
for any existing constituency
which does not exceed 2000, we cannot
be charged with extravagance. Lord
John Russell, if he must needs unsettle
his own handiwork, and assume,
for the future, the part of a mere
political cobbler, can very easily
spare us the required number: at all
events, if he does not, his bills should
be summarily rejected. Hitherto we
have not asked for reform, or for any
increase in the number of our national
representatives. We were contented to
leave matters as they were, so long as
no change was proposed. But now
that the proposal for a change has been
made, and made on the part of Ministers,
the people of Scotland will be
strangely wanting in duty to themselves,
and in fidelity to their country,
if they do not insist upon a fair measure
of justice. And they must do it
early. Upon the arrangement made
with regard to the English boroughs,
depends our sole chance of increased
Scottish representation. If we wait
until the English bill has passed into
a law, we need not hope to extort
from the ministry the concession of
a single member.</p>

<p>We ought, perhaps, to say&mdash;for it
is as well to exhaust the subject&mdash;that
we have no objection to make to the
minor measures of detail contained in
the Lord Advocate's Scottish bill. He
stated, very truly, that the manufacture
of fictitious votes was a system
which ought to be put an end to; and
also, very fairly, that no one political
party was more chargeable than another
with blame in this matter.
Without, then, inquiring too curiously
into the origin of the system, we shall
simply express our entire concurrence
in the sentiments of the learned lord,
and our acquiescence in the remedy
which he proposes.</p>

<p>We cannot, however, regard the
Scottish measure otherwise than as
entirely subsidiary to that proposed
by Lord John Russell for England.
In our opinion, the noble lord has
brought an old house about his ears.
He wants to do two things which are
hardly reconcilable. He seeks to
retain the nomination boroughs, with
such change only as may give a colour
for their retention; and, at the
same time, in other places, to increase
the popular franchise; and this he has
managed in so clumsy a way, that
he has only succeeded in unsettling
what was fixed, without providing for
stability for the future. Even if the
Radical party were contented with
his measure&mdash;which they are not&mdash;and
if they religiously abstained from
urging their peculiar panaceas on our
acceptance, it is quite plain that sufficient
matter of discord must arise
out of this bill, to give full employment
to the Legislature for several
years to come. It is an inflammatory,
not a sedative prescription: it
is rather a blister than an opiate.
In the Reform Bill of 1832, a distinct
principle can be traced, though the
details are not always consistent with
it. In this measure there is no principle
at all. It is on all hands allowed
that, in one respect at least, the Reform
Act has not improved the character
of the Legislature. Under its
operation, a class of men decidedly
inferior to their predecessors in talent,
training, sagacity, and mental
acquirement, have found their way
into Parliament. Questions of national
import are less considered&mdash;certainly
less thoroughly understood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
than formerly; and class interests, too
often antagonistic to sound general
policy, are advocated, with a selfish
and pertinacious zeal. It may be
said that this is an evil inseparable
from popular representation; and so
it is, to a certain extent: but the evil
will be greater or less according to
the prejudice or the enlightenment of
the representatives. It is a huge
mistake to suppose, though it is constantly
assumed by public writers,
and even made matter of boast by
orators upon the hustings, that men
are sent to the House of Commons
to represent this or that class, community,
or interest, without reference
to any other consideration. They are
sent there for no such purpose. The
whole tenor of their deliberations
ought to be directed towards the
general wellbeing of the community;
and if this principle is disregarded,
public debate degenerates into a contest
of classes. We shall find, on
observation, that very large constituencies
rarely send distinguished statesmen
to Parliament; the reason for
which, as we take it, is, that the representative
is expected to identify
himself entirely with the peculiar interests
of the electors. We require
from judges, who administer the laws,
an entire absence of any personal interest
in the suit which is brought
before them. We cannot exercise
the same strictness in the case of
those who make the laws; but this
at least is clear, that the higher the
representative standard can be raised
in point of intelligence, the better.
And how is this to be secured? Not,
certainly, by lowering the franchise,
as Lord John Russell proposes, so as
to let in a flood of ignorance and
prejudice upon the existing electoral
body&mdash;not certainly by increasing
the number of those who estimate
every measure solely by the effect
which it is calculated to have upon
themselves. We all know that, in
addressing popular assemblies, the
first and most effective appeal which
the demagogue can make, is directed
to the self-interest of his audience.
It must always be so&mdash;for this plain
reason, that ill-educated men, who
have neither the leisure nor the capacity
for reflection, invariably act
upon the motive of self-interest. They
know, or think they know, what would
be good for themselves; and very seldom,
indeed, do they take pains to
investigate further. Hence the popularity
with the lower orders of such
subjects as the reduction of taxation,
no matter by what means
accomplished&mdash;as the demolition of
the Established Church, as the cheap
loaf, and many others. They will
not listen to&mdash;or, if they do, they cannot
understand&mdash;any arguments to
the contrary; and they measure out
their favour to the speaker or candidate,
precisely according to the degree
in which he coincides with their own
prejudices. Orators, ancient and modern,
who understood their art, have
invariably attempted to reconcile their
conclusions with the self-interest of
their audiences, rather than appeal to
the higher motives of truth, justice,
or moral obligation. It is on account
of this natural tendency that, after
such deliberation as Lord John Russell
has mercifully allowed us, we are
forced to express our conviction that
his proposed measures are eminently
mischievous and impolitic. Being so,
and entertaining very serious doubts
whether he really expected to carry
them, they seem to us eminently
stupid, and, when taken in conjunction
with other recent exhibitions, we
can hardly resist the conclusion that,
as a political leader, Lord John Russell
has very nearly fulfilled his mission.</p>

<p>Such are the views which have
occurred to us on perusing the
draughts of the contemplated measures.
Some points we could well
desire to have reconsidered, had the
necessary time been allowed us; on
others&mdash;such, for example, as the
changes which ought to be made on
the existing system of Scottish representation&mdash;we
have long ago formed a
calm, deliberate, and dispassionate
opinion. The haste with which Lord
John Russell seems inclined to force
on his incongruous measures, argues
but little confidence, on his part, of
their actual wisdom, or of their
fitness to withstand scrutiny. It is,
of course, desirable that no measure
should be unnecessarily delayed; but
there is a wide difference between the
fair and proper determination of a
Minister to have his project discussed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
with all convenient speed, and that
indecent hurry which deprives the
country at large, and the organs of
public opinion, of the opportunity of
duly considering his plan, and weighing
it as its importance deserves. Lord
John Russell, in this instance&mdash;we are
sorry that we cannot use a milder expression&mdash;has
attempted a discreditable
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-de-main</i>. Up to the last moment
the nature of his proposed measures
was not divulged to the public,
although he had ample means within
his power of affording general information.
Yet no sooner was the bill
brought in&mdash;it not even having been
printed or tabled when leave was
given to introduce it&mdash;than a single
fortnight was arbitrarily fixed as the
intervening period before the second
reading, upon which, in the general
case, the principle of a bill depends!
We do not profess to be adepts in
Parliamentary lore and precedent,
but it does strike us that, when no
urgency can be alleged, a measure of
this sort, affecting as it does the
whole interests of the Empire, and involving
a change which, if not organic,
is certainly enormous, ought most assuredly
to be submitted to the public
for a reasonable time before it is
forced through the House of Commons.
However late examples on
the other side of the Channel may
have prepossessed Lord John Russell
in favour of long secresy and rapid
subsequent action, we cannot as yet
allow him to assume the functions of
a dictator. Were he a wiser man
than he has shown himself to be, his
schemes might require less deliberation;
but he cannot now expect, after
his many failures and abortive devices,
that any party will take him on
trust; or repose, without full investigation,
confidence in his powers of
statesmanship. What is worse, there
is a general impression abroad that
the Cabinet has not been at unity
regarding the nature of the measure
to be proposed. We can readily believe
it. In a junta so constituted,
there must have been considerable
clashing of private and of public interests;
and if it should turn out that
the former have prevailed, it needs,
we think, little argument to show that
the greater was the necessity for giving
the public time to deliberate
seriously upon a question of such
paramount importance. We have
outlived the days of "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic volo, sic
jubeo</i>." We recollect the time when
Lord John Russell assumed the bearing
of a Tribune of the people; and
if his memory is defective on that
point, we refer him to Mr Roebuck's
lately published <cite>History of the Whig
Ministry</cite>. He may now, if he chooses,
disown the part; but if so, he must
submit to the fate which has overtaken
all lapsed Tribunes. He is not
now without competitors. The modern
Sicinius Velutus and Junius
Brutus, genuine Tribunes of the people,
are watching him as closely
as their prototypes did Coriolanus;
and he is not the less selected for
their victim, because, at the present
moment, they appear to b, favourably
disposed. What urgency was
there on the present occasion? If for
twenty years it has not been thought
necessary to make any violent change
on the working of the constitution,
surely a longer period than a fortnight
ought to have been granted, in order
that men, both within and without
the Houses of Parliament, might consider
the principle and master the details
of a measure which is entirely to
alter the electoral arrangements of
the empire. We cannot help thinking
that, if Lord John Russell could have
calculated upon any considerable degree
of public support&mdash;if he had expected
to see monster-meetings held
in the towns for the purpose of backing
up his schemes&mdash;he would not
have exhibited such unmistakable
symptoms of hurry. If the coin which
he tenders is a good one, and of sound
metal, it will bear inspection; if, on
the contrary, it is a mere counterfeit,
there is the more need of scrutiny.
That it is counterfeit, we have not the
least shadow of a doubt. It is not
always our fortune to coincide in the
political opinions advocated by the
<cite>Times</cite>; but we are glad that, in the
present instance, there is no difference
in our views as to the practical
working of the measure, one certain
result of which would be the continual
introduction of new elements of strife
into the Legislature. "We have not
alluded," says a late writer in the
<cite>Times</cite>, "to a tithe of the evils incident
to the protracted and detailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
operation now recommended by the
Premier. Every Parliament, every
Session, every election&mdash;and we have,
on the average, a new member once
a fortnight&mdash;the fires of party spirit
would be fed with a new politico-judicial
process. Borough would be
dragged into Parliament in requital
for borough, and the result would be
a series of angry retaliations, or of
disgraceful compromises. We do not
hesitate to avow our belief, that the
operation of gradual reforms, advised
by Lord John Russell, would take up
at least one-third of the time of the
House of Commons for the next twenty
years, and, after all, disappoint
the intentions of its author, by driving
Parliament to some much larger measure
than any it has yet seriously entertained.
The last Reform Act was
a summary, a severe, and, in some
respects, a final measure. Accordingly,
the wounds it inflicted were
soon healed, and in two or three years
everybody acquiesced in it. The present
measure is expressly made not
to be final. The ship leaves the port
with the fire already smouldering in
its cargo, the leak already gaping in
its timbers; and, instead of an end
of controversy, we have only the beginning
of the end."</p>

<p>Our old acquaintance, the Jew Bill,
now figures as a clause in the new
measure of reform. It seems as if
the introduction of a vast flood of
electoral ignorance would not altogether
satisfy the noble lord. The
House of Commons, in order to approach
his ideas of perfection, must
also cease to be Christian. Is this a bill
which ought, in any shape, to receive
the support of the people of England?</p>

<p>Just as our last sheets were passing through the press, we learn that
the Ministry have resigned. We are not surprised by the intelligence.
We are exceedingly glad, however, to think that they cannot draw upon
the country for any fund of credit on account of their proposed reform
measures, which clearly was their object; and that, by general acquiescence,
their scheme, even before discussion, was condemned. We do not claim for
the author of "Cupid in the Cabinet," which appeared in our last Number,
the possession of <em>clairvoyance</em>; nevertheless, his vaticination has been most
signally and literally fulfilled.</p>

courses of the other Ngari rivers as he has done. The upper streams of both Indus
and Sutlej&mdash;the one as flowing past Ladakh from the range of Kylass, and the other
past Chaprung from the Rakas lake&mdash;are represented with a general truth; but
instead of tracing them westward to their true debouchments in the Punjaub, under
the well-known names just mentioned, the Ganges is made to draw its waters from
the combination of these two Tibetan streams, thus acquiring an imaginary extension
of several hundred miles.&mdash;(See <cite>Memoir of a Map of Hindostan</cite>, 1778, p. 102.)</p></div>

thirty years ago, with the view of tracing the original birthplace of the Hungarian
race, which he conceived was to be found in Tibet. Moorcroft, on one of his expeditions,
whilst resident at Ladakh, encountered him travelling in the garb of an Armenian, and
obtained for him from the khalun, or minister, permission to reside in the monastery
of Zanskar, (south-west of Lé). Here he spent several years mastering the Tibetan
literature, and composing a grammar and dictionary of the language. This
great work was carried on when, for four months, the thermometer was below zero,
in a room nine feet square, and without a fire! He afterwards proceeded to Calcutta,
and resided there till 1841 or 1842, engaged, under some patronage from the
Bengal government and Asiatic Society, in publishing the works above mentioned,
and many other notices of Tibetan literature.

<p>
In 1842 he visited the hill-station of Darjeeling, in sanguine expectation of being
able to prosecute a long-meditated journey to Lhassa, but shortly after his arrival
was seized with fever, and died.</p></div>
